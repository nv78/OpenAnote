# Marketing Materials Overview

This directory contains information related to case studies, and our AI day / Panacea launch events. We also share some other marketing related initiatives our team is involved in to help make AI more accessible.

## AI Events

Our team has built a community of thousands of AI practitioners in New York. We are partnering with Mindstone to expand our AI events across the USA in 2025, and are looking for speakers and community sponsors in cities across the country. Feel free to join our slack channel to stay up to date with the latest events, and reach out to Natan to get involved. We post abbreviated versions of the talks on our youtube channel and linkedin page, and are grateful for the following speakers through 2024.
