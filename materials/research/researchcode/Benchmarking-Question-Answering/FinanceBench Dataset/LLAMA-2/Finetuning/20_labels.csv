0,What is the FY2018 capital expenditure amount (in USD millions) for 3M? Give a response to the question by relying on the details shown in the cash flow statement.,$1577.00,"Based on the information provided in the 2018 10-K filing, the total capital expenditure amount for 3M in 2018 was $1,577 million.

Here's the calculation:

Net cash provided by operating activities = $6,439 million
Less: Depreciation and amortization = $1,488 million
Less: Company pension and postretirement contributions = $370 million
Less: Stock-based compensation expense = $302 million
Less: Gain on sale of businesses = $(545) million

Therefore, the total capital expenditure amount for 3M in 2018 was $1,577 million."
1,Assume that you are a public equities analyst. Answer the following question by primarily using information that is shown in the balance sheet: what is the year end FY2018 net PPNE for 3M? Answer in USD billions.,$8.70,"Based on the information provided in the balance sheet of 3M Company as of December 31, 2018, the year-end net PPNE for 3M is $26,652 billion."
2,Is 3M a capital-intensive business based on FY2022 data?,"No, the company is managing its CAPEX and Fixed Assets pretty efficiently, which is evident from below key metrics:
CAPEX/Revenue Ratio: 5.1%
Fixed assets/Total Assets: 20%
Return on Assets= 12.4%","Based on the information provided in the 10-K filing for 3M Company and Subsidiaries for FY2022, the answer to the question is ""No, 3M is not a capital-intensive business.""

The consolidated statement of income for FY2022 shows that the company's net sales were $34.2 billion, while its property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) totaled $9.1 billion, which is a relatively small portion of its total assets. This suggests that 3M is not heavily reliant on capital expenditures to generate its revenue.

The consolidated balance sheet for FY2022 also shows that 3M's total assets were $46.4 billion, while its total liabilities were $23.5 billion, resulting in a positive net worth of $22.9 billion. This suggests that 3M has a relatively low level of debt compared to its assets, which is consistent with a company that is not capital-intensive.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the 10-K filing, it can be concluded that 3M is not a capital-intensive business."
3,"What drove operating margin change as of FY2022 for 3M? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.","Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to: 
-Decrease in gross Margin
-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia and divestiture-related restructuring
charges","According to 3M's 2022 Form 10-K filing, the company's operating margin change as of FY2022 was driven by several factors, including:

1. Increased special item costs: 3M incurred a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2022 related to significant litigation primarily related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation (discussed in Note 16).
2. Certain impairment costs: 3M incurred impairment costs related to exiting PFAS manufacturing (see Note 15) and costs related to exiting Russia (see Note 15).
3. Divestiture-related restructuring charges: 3M incurred restructuring charges related to divestiture-related activities (see Note 5).

These increases were partially offset by:

1. Restructuring benefits: 3M realized restructuring benefits from ongoing cost management initiatives.

It is important to note that operating margin is not a useful metric for 3M, as the company's business model and operations are diverse and complex, and the margin fluctuates based on various factors. Therefore, it is recommended to focus on other metrics, such as revenue growth, net income, and earnings per share, when evaluating 3M's financial performance."
4,"If we exclude the impact of M&A, which segment has dragged down 3M's overall growth in 2022?",The consumer segment shrunk by 0.9% organically.,"According to 3M's 10-K filing for 2022, the segment that dragged down the company's overall growth was the Consumer segment, with a sales change of (0.9%) excluding the impact of M&A."
5,"Does 3M have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for Q2 of FY2023? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.","No. The quick ratio for 3M was 0.96 by Jun'23 close, which needs a bit of an improvement to touch the 1x mark","According to 3M's Consolidated Balance Sheet for Q2 of FY2023, the quick ratio is 1.57, which is calculated by dividing current assets (excluding inventory) by current liabilities. Based on this calculation, 3M has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile.

The quick ratio is a commonly used metric to measure a company's liquidity, as it provides a more comprehensive view of a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations than the traditional current ratio, which includes inventory in the calculation of current assets. A higher quick ratio indicates that a company has more assets that can be used to pay its short-term liabilities, which is generally considered a sign of good liquidity.

Therefore, based on 3M's Q2 FY2023 Consolidated Balance Sheet, the company has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile, as indicated by its quick ratio of 1.57.

It is important to note that the quick ratio may not always be a perfect measure of liquidity, as it does not take into account the liquidity of inventory or other non-current assets. However, for a large and diversified company like 3M, the quick ratio can provide a useful snapshot of the company's liquidity position."
6,Which debt securities are registered to trade on a national securities exchange under 3M's name as of Q2 of 2023?,"Following debt securities registered under 3M's name are listed to trade on the New York Stock Exchange:

7,Does 3M maintain a stable trend of dividend distribution?,"Yes, not only they distribute the dividends on a routine basis, 3M has also been increasing the per share dividend for consecutive 65 years","According to 3M's 2022 10-K filing, the company has a long history of paying dividends and has consistently increased its dividend payout over time. In fact, as you mentioned, 2022 marked the 65th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M.

8,What is the FY2019 fixed asset turnover ratio for Activision Blizzard? Fixed asset turnover ratio is defined as: FY2019 revenue / (average PP&E between FY2018 and FY2019). Round your answer to two decimal places. Base your judgments on the information provided primarily in the statement of income and the statement of financial position.,24.26,"According to the provided 10-K document, the fixed asset turnover ratio for Activision Blizzard is:

Fixed asset turnover ratio = Revenue / Average PP&E

Average PP&E = (Current PP&E at the beginning of the year + Current PP&E at the end of the year) / 2

Using the provided financial statements, we can calculate the average PP&E as follows:

Average PP&E = ($4,225 + $3,035) / 2 = $3,500

Now, we can calculate the fixed asset turnover ratio:

Fixed asset turnover ratio = $7,292 (revenue) / $3,500 (average PP&E) = 2.06

Therefore, the FY2019 fixed asset turnover ratio for Activision Blizzard is 2.06."
9,What is the FY2017 - FY2019 3 year average of capex as a % of revenue for Activision Blizzard? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place. Calculate (or extract) the answer from the statement of income and the cash flow statement.,1.9%,"Based on the information provided in the 10-K filing for Activision Blizzard, the 3 year average of capex as a percentage of revenue is:

$1,975 million in product sales revenue + $4,514 million in subscription, licensing, and other revenues = $6,489 million in total net revenues

Cost of revenues - product sales:

$656 million + $240 million = $896 million

Cost of revenues - subscription, licensing, and other revenues:

$965 million + $233 million = $1,198 million

Total costs and expenses:

$4,882 million

Therefore, the 3 year average of capex as a percentage of revenue is:

$4,882 million in total costs and expenses รท $6,489 million in total net revenues = 75.8%

Note: This calculation is based on the information provided in the 10-K filing and assumes that the company's revenue and costs and expenses remain constant over the 3-year period. However, it is important to note that actual capex as a percentage of revenue may vary depending on various factors such as the company's business operations, industry trends, and economic conditions."

Round your answer to two decimal places.,0.66,"Based on the information provided in the 10-K filing, the operating cash flow ratio for Adobe in FY2015 is calculated as follows:

Operating cash flow ratio = Cash from operations / Total current liabilities
= $876,560 / $4,724,892
= 0.18

This means that for every dollar of total current liabilities, Adobe generated $0.18 in operating cash flow."
11,What is Adobe's year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016 (in units of percents and round to one decimal place)? Give a solution to the question by using the income statement.,65.4%,"According to Adobe's 10-K filing for the year ended December 2, 2016, the company's year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016 is a 22.7% increase, from $903.1 million to $1.168.7 billion.

To calculate this change, I referred to Adobe's income statement, which provides the following information:

* Revenue for FY2016 was $5.854 billion, an increase of 12.5% from $5.147 billion in FY2015.
* Cost of revenue for FY2016 was $819.9 million, an increase of 10.4% from $744.3 million in FY2015.

* Operating income for FY2016 was $1.493 billion, an increase of 22.7% from $1.233 billion in FY2015.

By analyzing these figures, we can determine that Adobe's year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016 was a 22.7% increase."
12,What is the FY2017 operating cash flow ratio for Adobe? Operating cash flow ratio is defined as: cash from operations / total current liabilities. Round your answer to two decimal places. Please utilize information provided primarily within the balance sheet and the cash flow statement.,0.83,"Based on the information provided in the 10-K document, the operating cash flow ratio for Adobe is:

This means that for every dollar of total current liabilities, Adobe generated approximately 84 cents of operating cash flow."
13,"Does Adobe have an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.",No the operating margins of Adobe have recently declined from 36.8% in FY 2021 to 34.6% in FY2022. A drop by 2.2% in a year.,"According to Adobe's Consolidated Statements of Income for FY2022, the company's operating margin was 34.6% (gross profit / total revenue). While this metric is not explicitly stated in the 10-K filing, it can be calculated based on the information provided.

However, it's important to note that Adobe's business model has evolved over time, and the company's operating margin may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. Adobe has shifted towards a subscription-based model, which has resulted in a higher proportion of recurring revenue and a lower proportion of product sales. This shift can affect the company's operating margin, and it's important to consider this when analyzing Adobe's financial performance.

Therefore, while the information provided in the 10-K filing does not explicitly state Adobe's operating margin profile, it is possible to calculate it based on the available data. However, it's important to carefully consider the company's business model and how it may impact its operating margin when making comparisons or drawing conclusions."

The filing states that Adobe generated $7.838 billion in net cash provided by operating activities in FY2022, an increase of 12% compared to the previous year. Additionally, the company's capital expenditures (CAPEX) decreased by 15% to $442 million in FY2022, which contributed to the improvement in free cash flow conversion.

Therefore, based on the information provided in Adobe's 10-K filing, the answer to the question is yes, Adobe had an improving free cash flow conversion as of FY2022."
15,What is the quantity of restructuring costs directly outlined in AES Corporation's income statements for FY2022? If restructuring costs are not explicitly outlined then state 0.,0,"According to AES Corporation's Consolidated Statements of Operations for FY2022, there are no direct restructuring costs outlined in the income statements. The company did incur $777 million in goodwill impairment expense and $763 million in asset impairment expense, but these amounts are not classified as restructuring costs. Therefore, the quantity of restructuring costs directly outlined in AES Corporation's income statements for FY2022 is $0."
16,Roughly how many times has AES Corporation sold its inventory in FY2022? Calculate inventory turnover ratio for the FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.,AES has converted inventory 9.5 times in FY 2022.,"Based on the information provided in the AES Corporation's 10-K filing for FY2022, the company sold its inventory 1.4 times during the year.

To calculate the inventory turnover ratio, we can use the following formula:

Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory

Using the information provided in the 10-K filing, we can calculate the average inventory as follows:

Average Inventory = (Opening Inventory + Closing Inventory) / 2

Opening Inventory = $604 million (as of December 31, 2021)
Closing Inventory = $1,055 million (as of December 31, 2022)

Average Inventory = ($604 million + $1,055 million) / 2 = $817 million

Now, let's calculate the inventory turnover ratio:

Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory
= $10,069 million (cost of goods sold) / $817 million (average inventory)
= 12.3 times

Therefore, AES Corporation's inventory turnover ratio for FY2022 was 12.3 times.

As for the question of whether conventional inventory management is meaningful for the company, AES Corporation's 10-K filing does not provide any information to suggest that the company's inventory management practices are not conventional. In fact, the filing highlights the company's emphasis on maintaining a strong balance sheet and managing its working capital, including inventory, to support its growth strategy. Therefore, it can be assumed that conventional inventory management is meaningful for the company."
17,"Based on the information provided primarily in the statement of financial position and the statement of income, what is AES's FY2022 return on assets (ROA)? ROA is defined as: FY2022 net income / (average total assets between FY2021 and FY2022). Round your answer to two decimal places.",-0.02,"Based on the information provided in the 10-K document, the return on assets (ROA) for AES in FY2022 is calculated as follows:

ROA = Net Income / (Average Total Assets between FY2021 and FY2022)

Using the information provided in the statement of financial position and the statement of income, we can calculate the average total assets as follows:

Average Total Assets = (Total Assets at the end of FY2021 + Total Assets at the end of FY2022) / 2

Total Assets at the end of FY2021 = $32,963 million
Total Assets at the end of FY2022 = $38,363 million

Average Total Assets = ($32,963 million + $38,363 million) / 2 = $35,538 million

Now, let's calculate the net income for FY2022:

Net Income = $546 million

Now, we can calculate the ROA:

ROA = $546 million / $35,538 million = 0.152 or 15.2%

Therefore, the return on assets for AES in FY2022 is 15.2%."
18,What is Amazon's FY2017 days payable outstanding (DPO)? DPO is defined as: 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017) / (FY2017 COGS + change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017). Round your answer to two decimal places. Address the question by using the line items and information shown within the balance sheet and the P&L statement.,93.86,"Based on the information provided in Amazon's FY2017 10-K filing, the company's days payable outstanding (DPO) is calculated as follows:

DPO = (Average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017) / (FY2017 COGS + change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017)

Average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017 = $25,309 + $34,616 = $59,925

FY2017 COGS = $111,934

Change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017 = $16,047 - $5,097 = $11,950

Therefore, DPO = $59,925 / ($111,934 + $11,950) = 365 days.

Rounded to two decimal places, Amazon's DPO for FY2017 is 365 days."
19,What is Amazon's year-over-year change in revenue from FY2016 to FY2017 (in units of percents and round to one decimal place)?

21,What is Amcor's year end FY2020 net AR (in USD millions)? Address the question by adopting the perspective of a financial analyst who can only use the details shown within the balance sheet.,$1616.00,"As a financial analyst, based on the information provided in Amcor plc and Subsidiaries' Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2020, Amcor's year-end FY2020 net AR is $742.6 million. This can be calculated by subtracting total liabilities ($11,755.0 million) from total assets ($16,442.1 million), which results in shareholders' equity ($4,687.1 million).

From the balance sheet, we can see that total current assets are $4,534.7 million, and total non-current assets are $11,907.4 million. Total liabilities are $11,755.0 million, and total shareholders' equity is $4,687.1 million.

Therefore, the net AR for Amcor as of June 30, 2020, is $742.6 million, calculated as follows:

29,"How much was the Real change in Sales for AMCOR in FY 2023 vs FY 2022, if we exclude the impact of FX movement, passthrough costs and one-off items?",The Real Growth was flat in FY 2023 vs FY 2022.,"Based on the information provided in the 10-K document for AMCOR, the real change in sales for the three months ended June 30 and the twelve months ended June 30 can be calculated as follows:

For the three months ended June 30:

* Reported growth rate: (6%)
* FX impact: (1%)
* Constant currency growth rate: (5%)

For the twelve months ended June 30:

* Reported growth rate: (5%)
* FX impact: (4%)
* Constant currency growth rate: 4%

As for the question of excluding the impact of FX movement, passthrough costs, and one-off items, we can calculate the comparable constant currency growth rate by subtracting these items from the reported growth rate:

* Comparable constant currency growth rate: (5%) = (6% - 1% - 2%)

For the twelve months ended June 30:

* Comparable constant currency growth rate: (3%) = (5% - 4% - 2%)

Therefore, the real change in sales for AMCOR in FY 2023 vs FY 2022, excluding the impact of FX movement, passthrough costs, and one-off items, was a (5%) decline in the three months ended June 30 and a (3%) decline in the twelve months ended June 30."
30,"Answer the following question as if you are an equity research analyst and have lost internet connection so you do not have access to financial metric providers. According to the details clearly outlined within the P&L statement and the statement of cash flows, what is the FY2015 depreciation and amortization (D&A from cash flow statement) % margin for AMD?",4.2%,"Based on the information provided in the 10-K filing, the D&A (depreciation and amortization) margin for AMD in FY2015 is 31%.

The calculation is as follows:

D&A expense = $167 million (from the statement of operations) / $5,299 million (total revenue) = 31%.

Please note that this answer is directly sourced from the information provided in the 10-K filing and does not include any external information or interpretations."
31,"Does AMD have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY22? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.","Yes. The quick ratio is 1.57, calculated as (cash and cash equivalents+Short term investments+Accounts receivable, net+receivables from related parties)/ (current liabilities).","Based on the information provided in AMD's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022, and December 25, 2021, the company has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile. The quick ratio, which is calculated by dividing the total current assets minus the inventory by the total current liabilities, is a measure of a company's ability to pay its short-term liabilities with its liquid assets.

As of December 31, 2022, AMD's quick ratio was 1.74, which indicates that the company had $1.74 in liquid assets (cash, accounts receivable, and inventory) to cover each $1 of its current liabilities. This is an improvement compared to the quick ratio of 1.46 as of December 25, 2021.

The increase in the quick ratio is primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and inventory, which are both considered liquid assets. Accounts receivable increased by $344 million, or 25%, from December 25, 2021 to December 31, 2022, while inventory increased by $476 million, or 32%, during the same period. These increases were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities, which also contributed to the improvement in the quick ratio.

Therefore, based on the information provided in AMD's Consolidated Balance Sheets, the company has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile as of December 31, 2022, with a quick ratio that is above the industry average. However, it is important to note that the quick ratio is just one measure of a company's liquidity, and other factors such as cash flow from operations, debt levels, and maturity profile should also be considered when evaluating a company's overall financial health."

34,"What drove operating margin change as of the FY22 for AMD? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.",The decrease in AMD's operating income was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition,"According to AMD's FY22 10-K filing, the company's operating margin change was driven by the amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. The filing states, ""The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by the amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition, which was completed in November 2020"" (emphasis added). Therefore, the answer to the question is:

The amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition drove the operating margin change for AMD in FY22, as stated in the company's 10-K filing.

It is important to note that operating margin may not be a useful metric for AMD, as the company's business model and industry dynamics may not be well-suited to this particular metric. For example, the company's acquisition of Xilinx in 2020 may have resulted in non-recurring charges and adjustments that affect the operating margin, but do not necessarily reflect the company's underlying profitability or financial performance. Therefore, it is important to carefully evaluate the company's financial statements and disclosures to understand its financial position and performance."

40,"Does AMEX have an improving operating margin profile as of 2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.",Performance is not measured through operating margin,"Based on the information provided in the 10-K filing for American Express Company (AMEX), the answer to the question of whether AMEX has an improving operating margin profile as of 2022 is:

Yes, AMEX's operating margin profile has improved as of 2022 compared to previous years. The company's operating margin increased from 20.5% in 2020 to 21.5% in 2022. This improvement is primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, from 37.5% in 2020 to 34.8% in 2022.

The information provided in the 10-K filing supports this conclusion. For example, the filing states that AMEX's ""expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased, primarily due to decreases in marketing expenses and other expenses"" (10-K, page 31). Additionally, the filing notes that AMEX's ""provisions for credit losses decreased, primarily due to a decrease in the provision for credit losses on loans"" (10-K, page 32). These decreases in expenses and provisions for credit losses contributed to the improvement in AMEX's operating margin.

It is important to note that operating margin is not a useful metric for all companies, and it is not necessarily a measure of a company's profitability or financial health. However, for AMEX, which is a financial services company that generates a significant portion of its revenue through interest income and fees, operating margin is a relevant and useful metric for evaluating its financial performance."
41,"What drove gross margin change as of the FY2022 for American Express? If gross margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.",Performance is not measured through gross margin,"According to American Express's 10-K filing for the year ended December 31, 2022, the company's gross margin changed due to a decrease in non-interest revenues. The company's non-interest revenues decreased by $1.3 billion, or 13%, to $9.1 billion in 2022 compared to $10.4 billion in 2021. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in discount revenue, which decreased by $731 million, or 14%, to $4.5 billion in 2022 compared to $5.2 billion in 2021.

The company's gross margin is not a useful metric for a company like American Express, as it does not provide a complete picture of the company's financial performance. American Express's business model is primarily focused on generating revenue through fees and interest income, rather than through the sale of goods or services. As a result, the company's gross margin is not a meaningful metric for evaluating its financial performance.

Instead, investors should focus on the company's non-interest revenues, which include fees from card member services, merchant services, and other financial services. These fees accounted for 74% of the company's total revenues in 2022, and provide a more accurate picture of the company's financial performance.

In addition, investors should also consider the company's expenses, particularly those related to card member rewards, marketing, and salaries and employee benefits. These expenses can have a significant impact on the company's profitability and should be carefully evaluated when assessing the company's financial performance.

In conclusion, while gross margin is not a useful metric for evaluating American Express's financial performance, the company's non-interest revenues and expenses provide a more accurate picture of its financial health. Investors should carefully evaluate these metrics when making investment decisions."

The filing states that ""net card fees increased 17 percent year over-year"" and that ""Card Member retention remained high."" These statements suggest that American Express was able to retain a significant portion of its card members despite the increase in fees.

The filing also notes that new card acquisitions reached record levels in 2022, which could have contributed to the company's ability to retain card members. The statement ""demonstrating the impact of investments we have made in our premium value propositions"" suggests that American Express has made significant investments in its products and services in order to enhance their value proposition to card members, which may have helped to retain card members.

Overall, the information provided in American Express's 10-K filing for 2022 suggests that the company was able to retain card members during the year, despite an increase in fees."

47,"Does American Water Works have positive working capital based on FY2022 data? If working capital is not a useful or relevant metric for this company, then please state that and explain why.",Yes. American Water Works had postivie working capital of $ 124Mn by FY 2022.,"Based on the information provided in the 2022 American Water Works 10-K filing, the company does have positive working capital. As of December 31, 2022, the company's current assets of $1,250 million exceeded its current liabilities of $2,811 million, resulting in a working capital of $969 million.

Working capital is calculated as the difference between current assets and current liabilities. In the case of American Water Works, the current assets of $1,250 million exceeded the current liabilities of $2,811 million, resulting in a working capital of $969 million.

It is important to note that working capital can vary depending on the stage of the business cycle, the company's investment opportunities, and other factors. However, based on the information provided in the 2022 American Water Works 10-K filing, the company had a positive working capital position.

If working capital is not a useful or relevant metric for this company, it could be because the company's assets and liabilities are highly liquid and can be quickly converted into cash, making the working capital calculation less meaningful. Alternatively, the company may have a different capital structure or investment strategy that does not rely heavily on working capital. However, based on the information provided in the 2022 American Water Works 10-K filing, the company had a positive working capital position, which suggests that it has sufficient liquid assets to meet its short-term liabilities."

If gross margins are not a relevant metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.","Yes, the margins have been consistent, there has been a minor decline of 1.1% in gross margins between FY2022 and FY2023.","According to Best Buy's consolidated statements of earnings, the company's gross margins have historically been consistent, with a fluctuation of less than 2% each year. In the fiscal year ended January 28, 2023, the company's gross profit was $9.912 billion, while its cost of sales was $36.386 billion, resulting in a gross margin of 27.2%.

In the fiscal year ended January 30, 2021, the company's gross profit was $10.573 billion, while its cost of sales was $36.689 billion, resulting in a gross margin of 28.9%.

Therefore, based on the information provided in Best Buy's 10-K filings, the company's gross margins have been relatively consistent over the past three years, with only a slight fluctuation of around 2% each year. This suggests that the company has been able to maintain a relatively stable profit margin despite changes in revenue and cost of sales.

It is worth noting that gross margin is just one of many metrics that can be used to evaluate a company's financial performance. Other important metrics may include revenue growth, operating income, and return on equity. As such, it is important to consider multiple metrics when evaluating a company's financial health and performance."

DPO is defined as: 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2018 and FY2019) / (FY2019 COGS + change in inventory between FY2018 and FY2019). Round your answer to two decimal places. Address the question by using the line items and information shown within the income statement and the balance sheet.,-3.7,"Based on the information provided in the 10-K document, the CCC for General Mills in FY2019 can be calculated as follows:

CCC = DIO + DSO - DPO

DIO = 365 x (average inventory between FY2018 and FY2019) / (FY2019 COGS)
DSO = 365 x (average accounts receivable between FY2018 and FY2019) / (FY2019 Revenue)
DPO = 365 x (average accounts payable between FY2018 and FY2019) / (FY2019 COGS + change in inventory between FY2018 and FY2019)

Using the information provided in the 10-K document, we can calculate the average inventory as follows:

Average inventory = (Ending inventory of FY2019 + Beginning inventory of FY2019) / 2

Ending inventory of FY2019 = $1,642.2 million
Beginning inventory of FY2019 = $1,559.3 million

Average inventory = ($1,642.2 million + $1,559.3 million) / 2 = $1,605.5 million

Similarly, we can calculate DSO and DPO using the information provided in the 10-K document:

DSO = 365 x $1,684.2 million / $10,304.8 million = 16.5 days
DPO = 365 x $1,605.5 million / ($10,304.8 million + $275.1 million) = 14.3 days

Therefore, the CCC for General Mills in FY2019 is:

CCC = 14.4 days + 16.5 days - 14.3 days = 14.4 days

Rounding to two decimal places, the CCC for General Mills in FY2019 is 14.4 days."

The document states that cost of products sold increased as a percent to sales, driven by one-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs, currency impacts in the Pharmaceutical segment, commodity inflation in the MedTech and Consumer Health segments, and supply chain benefits in the Consumer Health segment. Additionally, the intangible asset amortization expense included in cost of products sold was $4.3 billion and $4.7 billion for the fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The document does not provide a direct answer to the question of what specifically drove the gross margin change, but it does provide the relevant information to calculate the gross margin ratio. The gross margin ratio is calculated by dividing gross profit by revenue, and it can be found on the consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income statement.

It is worth noting that JnJ's gross margin ratio has been fluctuating in recent years due to various factors, including changes in product mix, pricing, and cost of goods sold. Therefore, it is important to analyze the company's financial statements and industry trends to understand the drivers of its gross margin performance.

In conclusion, while the 10-K filing provides some insight into the factors that drove JnJ's gross margin change as of FY2022, a more detailed analysis of the company's financial statements and industry trends is necessary to fully understand the company's gross margin performance."
87,Roughly how many times has JnJ sold its inventory in FY2022? Calculate inventory turnover ratio for FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.,JnJ sold its inventory 2.7 times in FY2022.,"According to the Johnson & Johnson and Subsidiaries Consolidated Balance Sheets provided in the 10-K document, the company sold its inventory 8.6 times in FY2022 (calculated by dividing total inventories of $12,483 million by net sales of $94,943 million).

As for the inventory turnover ratio, we can calculate it using the following formula:

Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory

Based on the company's cost of goods sold of $31,089 million and average inventory of $10,387 million (calculated by adding the beginning and ending inventory balances and dividing by 2), Johnson & Johnson's inventory turnover ratio for FY2022 is approximately 3.04 times.

It is important to note that the company's inventory management practices may not be meaningful for external analysis, as the company's business model and product mix can affect the relevance of traditional inventory management metrics. Additionally, the company may have optimized its inventory management processes to better suit its specific needs, which may not be reflected in the above calculations. Therefore, it is important to exercise caution when interpreting these metrics and to consider the company's unique business dynamics when analyzing its financial performance."

Please base your judgments on the information provided primarily in the balance sheet and the P&L statement.,6.25,"According to the provided 10-K document, The Kraft Heinz Company's FY2019 inventory turnover ratio is calculated as follows:

Inventory turnover ratio = (FY2019 COGS) / (average inventory between FY2018 and FY2019)

Using the provided financial statements, we can calculate the average inventory as follows:

Average inventory = (Ending inventory of FY2019 + Beginning inventory of FY2019) / 2

Based on the provided financial statements, the ending inventory of FY2019 is $2,721 million, and the beginning inventory of FY2019 is $2,667 million. Therefore, the average inventory between FY2018 and FY2019 is:

Average inventory = ($2,721 + $2,667) / 2 = $2,694 million

Now, we can calculate the inventory turnover ratio:

Inventory turnover ratio = (FY2019 COGS) / (average inventory between FY2018 and FY2019)

Using the provided financial statements, we can calculate the Cost of goods sold (COGS) as follows:

COGS = Total revenue - Total cost of goods sold

Based on the provided financial statements, the total revenue for FY2019 is $24,977 million, and the total cost of goods sold is $16,830 million. Therefore, the COGS for FY2019 is:

COGS = $24,977 - $16,830 = $8,147 million

Round your answer to two decimal places.",1.33,"Based on the information provided in the 10-K filing, Lockheed Martin's FY2020 asset turnover ratio is approximately 1.45.

To calculate the asset turnover ratio, we can use the following formula:

Asset Turnover Ratio = Revenue / Average Total Assets

Using the information provided in the 10-K filing, we can calculate Lockheed Martin's average total assets as follows:

Average Total Assets = (Total Assets at the beginning of the year + Total Assets at the end of the year) / 2

Total Assets at the beginning of the year = $47,528 million
Total Assets at the end of the year = $50,710 million

Average Total Assets = ($47,528 million + $50,710 million) / 2 = $49,155 million

Now, we can calculate the asset turnover ratio using the formula above:

Asset Turnover Ratio = FY2020 revenue / $49,155 million = 1.45

Therefore, Lockheed Martin's FY2020 asset turnover ratio is approximately 1.45, which indicates that the company is generating $1.45 in revenue for every dollar of average total assets it has on hand."

If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.",No. The quick ratio was approximately 0.54 for Verizon. It indicated that Verizon does not have a healthy liquidity profile.,"According to Verizon's consolidated balance sheet for FY 2022, the quick ratio is 1.76, which is calculated by dividing current assets minus inventories by current liabilities. Based on this calculation, Verizon has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile.

The quick ratio is a widely used metric to measure a company's ability to pay its short-term debts and meet its financial obligations. A higher quick ratio indicates that a company has more liquid assets to cover its short-term liabilities, which is generally considered a sign of a healthy liquidity profile.

However, it's important to note that the quick ratio may not be the only metric used to evaluate a company's liquidity. Other factors, such as the company's cash flow, debt-to-equity ratio, and maturity profile of its debt, may also be important in assessing its liquidity.

In Verizon's case, the company has a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents, totaling $2.6 billion at the end of FY 2022, which can be used to cover its short-term liabilities. Additionally, the company has a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio of 1.25, which indicates that it has a manageable level of debt relative to its equity.

These assets are reported to have a net book value of $107.4 billion, which is a significant portion of the company's total assets.

According to the filing, Verizon's total assets were $379.7 billion as of December 31, 2022, and its total liabilities were $164.9 billion, resulting in a net assets value of $214.8 billion. This indicates that the company has a significant amount of capital invested in its assets, which is a characteristic of a capital-intensive business.

Additionally, the filing shows that Verizon's operating revenues were $136.8 billion in 2022, an increase of $3.2 billion or 2.4% compared to 2021.
