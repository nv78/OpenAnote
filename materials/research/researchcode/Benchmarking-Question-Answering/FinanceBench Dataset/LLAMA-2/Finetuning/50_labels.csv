0,What is the FY2018 capital expenditure amount (in USD millions) for 3M? Give a response to the question by relying on the details shown in the cash flow statement.,$1577.00,"Based on the information provided in the 2018 10-K filing, the FY2018 capital expenditure amount for 3M is $1,577 million.

The information is found in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows under the ""Cash Flows from Investing Activities"" section. The table shows the total amount of capital expenditures for the year, which is listed as ""Purchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&E)"" and is shown as $1,577 million.

Therefore, the answer to the question is $1,577 million."
1,Assume that you are a public equities analyst. Answer the following question by primarily using information that is shown in the balance sheet: what is the year end FY2018 net PPNE for 3M? Answer in USD billions.,$8.70,"Based on the information provided in the 2018 10-K filing, the year end FY2018 net PPNE for 3M is $8,738 million."
2,Is 3M a capital-intensive business based on FY2022 data?,"No, the company is managing its CAPEX and Fixed Assets pretty efficiently, which is evident from below key metrics:
CAPEX/Revenue Ratio: 5.1%
Fixed assets/Total Assets: 20%
Return on Assets= 12.4%","Based on the information provided in the 10-K filing for 3M Company and Subsidiaries for FY2022, the answer to the question is no, 3M is not a capital-intensive business.

The consolidated statement of income for FY2022 shows that the company's net sales were $34.2 billion, while its property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) net of accumulated depreciation was $9.2 billion. This means that the company's PP&E assets made up approximately 27% of its net sales, which is not considered a high level of capital intensity.

Additionally, the consolidated balance sheet shows that the company's total assets were $46.5 billion, while its total liabilities were $24.7 billion, resulting in a net worth of $21.8 billion. This indicates that the company has a relatively low level of debt compared to its total assets, which is also indicative of a less capital-intensive business.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the 10-K filing, 3M can be classified as a business with a moderate level of capital intensity, rather than a highly capital-intensive one."
3,"What drove operating margin change as of FY2022 for 3M? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.","Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to: 
-Decrease in gross Margin
-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia and divestiture-related restructuring
charges","According to the 10-K document provided, the operating margin change for 3M as of FY2022 was driven by the following factors:

* Increased special item costs, primarily related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, resulting in a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2022.
* Certain impairment costs related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, as discussed in Note 15.
* Costs related to exiting Russia, as discussed in Note 15.
* Divestiture-related restructuring charges, as discussed in Note 5.
* Continued investment in key growth initiatives.

These factors led to an increase in SG&A expenses, measured as a percent of sales, in 2022 compared to the same period last year.

It is important to note that operating margin is not a useful metric for 3M, as the company's business model is focused on innovation and diversification, rather than margin expansion. As such, the company's financial performance is better evaluated through other metrics, such as revenue growth, earnings growth, and return on invested capital (ROIC).

The 10-K document does not provide information on the usefulness or appropriateness of using operating margin as a metric for 3M or any other company. However, it is generally accepted that operating margin is a useful metric for companies in the manufacturing and industrial sectors, as it provides insight into the efficiency of a company's operations and its ability to generate profits from its sales.

In conclusion, the operating margin change for 3M as of FY2022 was primarily driven by special item costs, impairment costs, and divestiture-related restructuring charges. While operating margin may be a useful metric for some companies, it is not a relevant or useful metric for 3M, given the company's business model and focus on innovation and diversification."
4,"If we exclude the impact of M&A, which segment has dragged down 3M's overall growth in 2022?",The consumer segment shrunk by 0.9% organically.,"According to the 10-K document provided, the segment that dragged down 3M's overall growth in 2022 was the Consumer segment, with a sales change of (0.9%) excluding the impact of M&A."
5,"Does 3M have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for Q2 of FY2023? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.","No. The quick ratio for 3M was 0.96 by Jun'23 close, which needs a bit of an improvement to touch the 1x mark","Based on the information provided in the 10-K document for 3M Company and Subsidiaries, the quick ratio for Q2 of FY2023 is 1.73. This is calculated by dividing the company's quick assets (cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and inventories) by its current liabilities.

The quick ratio is a measure of a company's ability to pay its short-term debts and meet its financial obligations. A higher quick ratio indicates that a company has a greater ability to pay its short-term liabilities and is generally considered a sign of financial health.

In this case, 3M Company's quick ratio of 1.73 indicates that for every dollar of current liabilities, the company has approximately 1.73 dollars of quick assets available to pay those liabilities. This is within a reasonable range for a company in 3M's industry and suggests that the company has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile.

It is important to note that the quick ratio is just one of many measures of a company's liquidity, and it should be considered in conjunction with other financial metrics, such as the current ratio and the debt-to-equity ratio, to get a more complete picture of a company's financial health."

Give a solution to the question by using the income statement.,65.4%,"Based on the income statement provided in the 10-K document, Adobe's year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016 is:

Unadjusted operating income for FY2016 was $1,493,602 million, which is a 20% increase from FY2015's unadjusted operating income of $903,095 million.

13,"Does Adobe have an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022?

A drop by 2.2% in a year.,"According to Adobe's Consolidated Statements of Income for FY2022, the company's operating margin was 34.5% ($6,098 million in operating income / $17,606 million in revenue). This indicates that Adobe's operating margin has improved compared to the previous year (FY2021), when the operating margin was 32.7% ($5,802 million in operating income / $15,785 million in revenue).

It is important to note that Adobe's operating margin can vary depending on the company's revenue mix and the cost structure of its various business segments. Therefore, it is not necessarily accurate to say that Adobe has an improving operating margin profile across all periods without analyzing the specific revenue and cost trends for each year.

In addition, it is important to recognize that Adobe's business model has evolved over time, with a shift towards subscription-based revenue and a growing emphasis on digital marketing and commerce solutions. This may impact the company's operating margin profile compared to historical periods, and it is important to consider these changes when evaluating Adobe's financial performance.

In summary, while Adobe's operating margin has improved in FY2022 compared to the previous year, it is not necessarily accurate to make a blanket statement about the company's operating margin profile without considering the specific revenue and cost trends for each year."

Calculate inventory turnover ratio for the FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.,AES has converted inventory 9.5 times in FY 2022.,"According to the consolidated balance sheet of AES Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2022, the company's inventory balance was $1,055 million. To calculate the inventory turnover ratio, we can use the following formula:

Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory

Based on the consolidated statement of operations, the company's cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $10,069 million. Using this amount, we can calculate the inventory turnover ratio as follows:

Inventory Turnover Ratio = $10,069 million / $1,055 million = 9.5

This means that AES Corporation sold its inventory approximately 9.5 times during the year ended December 31, 2022.

As for the conventional inventory management, AES Corporation does not provide any information in the 10-K filing to suggest that its inventory management practices are not meaningful. In fact, the company's balance sheet shows a significant amount of inventory, which suggests that inventory management is an important aspect of its operations. Therefore, we can assume that AES Corporation's inventory management practices are meaningful and relevant to its financial performance."

Based on the information provided in the 10-K filing, the average accounts payable for Amazon was $25,309 million in FY2016 and $34,616 million in FY2017. The company's cost of goods sold (COGS) was $111,934 million in FY2017, and there was a change in inventory of $4,844 million between FY2016 and FY2017.

Therefore, the DPO for Amazon in FY2017 can be calculated as follows:

DPO = ($25,309 million + $34,616 million) / ($111,934 million + $4,844 million) = 365 days

So, Amazon's DPO in FY2017 was 365 days."

20,"By drawing conclusions from the information stated only in the income statement, what is Amazon's FY2019 net income attributable to shareholders (in USD millions)?",$11588.00,"Based on the information provided in Amazon's FY2019 consolidated statement of operations, the net income attributable to shareholders is $3,033 million.

To calculate the net income, we need to subtract the operating expenses from the operating income. The operating income is calculated by subtracting the operating expenses from the total revenue.

Operating income = Total revenue - Operating expenses
= 280,522 - 173,760
= 106,762

Then, we need to subtract the interest expense, other non-operating income (expense), and the provision for income taxes from the operating income.

Net income = Operating income - Interest expense - Other non-operating income (expense) - Provision for income taxes
= 106,762 - (848) - (300) - (769)
= 105,653

Finally, we need to adjust the net income for the equity-method investment activity, which results in a net income of $3,033 million.

Therefore, Amazon's FY2019 net income attributable to shareholders is $3,033 million, based on the information provided in the consolidated statement of operations."

The quick ratio, which is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay its short-term debts, is not explicitly disclosed in the Consolidated Balance Sheets of Amcor plc and Subsidiaries for FY2023 and FY2022. Therefore, I cannot provide information on whether Amcor's quick ratio has improved or declined between these two fiscal years.

However, I can tell you that the quick ratio is an important metric that financial analysts use to evaluate a company's liquidity and ability to meet its short-term financial obligations. A higher quick ratio generally indicates that a company has more liquid assets available to pay its short-term debts, while a lower quick ratio may raise concerns about a company's ability to meet its short-term financial obligations.

In summary, while the quick ratio is not explicitly disclosed in the 10-K document, it is an important metric that financial analysts use to evaluate a company's liquidity and ability to meet its short-term financial obligations."

26,"Does AMCOR have an improving gross margin profile as of FY2023? If gross margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.",No. For AMCOR there has been a slight decline in gross margins by 0.8%.,"Based on the information provided in the Consolidated Statements of Income of Amcor plc and Subsidiaries for the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the gross margin of the company can be calculated as follows:

Gross Margin = Gross Profit / Net Sales

From the provided statements, we can see that the gross profit of Amcor for the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 are:

2023: $2,725 million
2022: $2,820 million

And the net sales of Amcor for the same years are:

2023: $14,694 million
2022: $14,544 million
2021: $12,861 million

Now, we can calculate the gross margin of Amcor as follows:

Gross Margin = $2,725 million (2023) / $14,694 million (2023) = 18.3%
Gross Margin = $2,820 million (2022) / $14,544 million (2022) = 19.3%
Gross Margin = $2,732 million (2021) / $12,861 million (2021) = 21.6%

Based on the above calculations, we can see that the gross margin of Amcor has improved from 2021 to 2023, with a gross margin percentage of 18.3% in 2023, compared to 21.6% in 2021, and 19.3% in 2022.

Therefore, the answer to the question ""Does AMCOR have an improving gross margin profile as of FY2023?"" is ""Yes.""

It's important to note that while the gross margin has improved, it's important to consider other financial metrics such as revenue growth, operating income, and net income to get a complete picture of the company's financial performance."

30,"Answer the following question as if you are an equity research analyst and have lost internet connection so you do not have access to financial metric providers. According to the details clearly outlined within the P&L statement and the statement of cash flows, what is the FY2015 depreciation and amortization (D&A from cash flow statement) % margin for AMD?",4.2%,"According to the 10-K filing, the FY2015 depreciation and amortization (D&A) expense as a percentage of revenue was 16.7%. This can be calculated by dividing the D&A expense of $167 million by the revenue of $3,991 million, resulting in a D&A expense as a percentage of revenue of 16.7%."
31,"Does AMD have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY22? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.","Yes. The quick ratio is 1.57, calculated as (cash and cash equivalents+Short term investments+Accounts receivable, net+receivables from related parties)/ (current liabilities).","Based on the information provided in AMD's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022, and December 25, 2021, the company has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile. The quick ratio, which is calculated by dividing the total current assets minus the inventory by the total current liabilities, is a useful metric for assessing a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations.

As of December 31, 2022, AMD's quick ratio was 1.66, which indicates that for every dollar of current liabilities, the company had $1.66 of quick assets (i.e., cash, accounts receivable, and inventory) that could be used to pay its short-term debts. This is a relatively healthy liquidity position, as a higher quick ratio generally indicates that a company has more flexibility to meet its short-term financial obligations.

In contrast, as of December 25, 2021, AMD's quick ratio was 1.37, which was also a relatively healthy position.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the 10-K filing, it can be concluded that AMD has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile as of December 31, 2022, and December 25, 2021.

It is important to note that the quick ratio is just one of many metrics used to evaluate a company's liquidity, and it may not provide a complete picture of a company's financial health. Other factors, such as the company's cash flow generation, debt maturity schedule, and access to external funding, may also be important in evaluating a company's liquidity position."

Therefore, the answer to the question is directly supported by the text in the 10-K filing.

It is worth noting that operating margin may not be a useful metric for AMD, as the company has a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on its balance sheet due to the Xilinx acquisition.

40,"Does AMEX have an improving operating margin profile as of 2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.",Performance is not measured through operating margin,"According to the Consolidated Statements of Income provided in the 10-K document, American Express's (AMEX) operating margin improved from 2020 to 2022. In 2020, AMEX's operating margin was 31.3%, which decreased to 28.6% in 2021 and then improved to 30.3% in 2022.

The operating margin is calculated by dividing AMEX's operating income by its revenues, excluding interest expense. In 2022, AMEX's operating income was $9.585 billion, and its revenues, excluding interest expense, were $52.862 billion. Therefore, AMEX's operating margin in 2022 was 18.0%.

The improvement in AMEX's operating margin from 2020 to 2022 can be attributed to several factors, including:

1. Revenue growth: AMEX's total revenues, excluding interest expense, increased by 14.3% from $42.380 billion in 2020 to $50.680 billion in 2022.
2. Expense management: AMEX's expenses as a percentage of revenues, excluding interest expense, decreased from 63.7% in 2020 to 59.3% in 2022. This was primarily due to a reduction in marketing expenses and a decrease in the cost of card member rewards.
3. Provisions for credit losses: AMEX's provisions for credit losses decreased by 44.4% from $4.730 billion in 2020 to $2.629 billion in 2022. This was due to a decrease in the company's loan portfolio and a reduction in the provision for credit losses as a percentage of revenues, excluding interest expense.

In conclusion, AMEX's operating margin improved from 2020 to 2022, primarily due to revenue growth, expense management, and a decrease in provisions for credit losses."
41,"What drove gross margin change as of the FY2022 for American Express? If gross margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.",Performance is not measured through gross margin,"According to American Express's Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2022, the gross margin change can be attributed to a decrease in net card fees. In 2022, net card fees totaled $6.07 billion, a decrease of $1.16 billion or 16% compared to 2021. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in purchase volume, which resulted in lower interchange revenue.

Gross margin is not a useful metric for American Express, as it does not provide a complete picture of the company's financial performance. American Express generates the majority of its revenue through its card member fees, which are not included in the gross margin calculation. Additionally, the company's revenue is diversified across multiple segments, including card member services, business development, and marketing, which are not reflected in the gross margin metric.

Working capital is calculated by subtracting the company's current liabilities from its current assets. As of December 31, 2022, American Water Works had current assets of $1,250 million and current liabilities of $2,811 million, resulting in a working capital of $1,250 - $2,811 = $1,561 million.

Therefore, the company has positive working capital, indicating that it has more current assets than current liabilities.

It is important to note that working capital is a measure of a company's liquidity and its ability to pay its short-term obligations. A positive working capital indicates that the company has sufficient liquid assets to cover its short-term liabilities and is in a good position to meet its financial obligations.

However, it is worth noting that the working capital ratio can vary depending on the industry and the company's business model. Some companies may have a higher or lower working capital ratio depending on their specific circumstances."
48,"In agreement with the information outlined in the income statement, what is the FY2015 - FY2017 3 year average net profit margin (as a %) for Best Buy?

This can be calculated by taking the net profit margin for each of the three fiscal years (FY2015, FY2016, and FY2017) and averaging them together.

Net Profit Margin (as a percentage) = (Net Earnings / Revenue) x 100

Net Earnings for FY2015 = $1,207 million
Revenue for FY2015 = $40,339 million

Net Profit Margin for FY2016 = ($897 million / $39,403 million) x 100 = 2.28%

Net Earnings for FY2017 = $1,235 million
Revenue for FY2017 = $41,406 million
Net Profit Margin for FY2017 = ($1,235 million / $41,406 million) x 100 = 3.03%

Therefore, General Mills retained 47.4% of its net earnings as cash dividends in FY2022."

The sales changes in 2022 consisted of a 6.9% increase in volume, a 0.8% decrease in price, and a 4.8% negative impact from currency exchange rates. These changes resulted in a total sales increase of 1.3% for the year. In comparison, in 2021, JnJ's sales increased by 13.6%, primarily due to a 12.9% increase in volume and a 0.7% increase in price.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM) did not go bankrupt by the end of 2021 Q1, and the company's financial statements do not provide information on the amount of money each shareholder could receive in the event of liquidation.

According to JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Q1 10-Q filing with the SEC, the company's total bankruptcy liquidation value was $1.36 trillion as of March 31, 2021. However, this value does not necessarily translate to the amount of money each shareholder could receive in a liquidation scenario.

The 10-K filing does not provide information on the distribution of assets in the event of liquidation, and it is not possible to accurately estimate the amount of money each shareholder could receive without additional information. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to your question.

96,"Are JPM's gross margins historically consistent (not fluctuating more than roughly 2% each year)? If gross margins are not a relevant metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.","Since JPM is a financial institution, gross margin is not a relevant metric.","Based on the information provided in JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s (JPM) 2022 10-K filing, the company's gross margins have been historically consistent, with fluctuations of less than 2% each year.

The company's operating expenses were $64.8 billion in 2022, an increase of 10.1% compared to 2021.

Based on this information, it appears that JPM's gross margins have been consistent over the past few years, with fluctuations within a relatively narrow range. However, it is important to note that the company's gross margins can be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in interest rates, market conditions, and the company's business mix.

If gross margins are not a relevant metric for JPM, it is because the company's business model and operations are complex and diverse, and gross margins may not provide a complete picture of the company's financial performance. For example, JPM's investment banking and asset management segments may have different gross margins than its consumer and commercial banking segments, and the company's overall gross margin may be influenced by factors such as interest rate margins, trading revenues, and non-interest income. In such cases, other financial metrics, such as return on equity (ROE) or return on assets (ROA), may be more informative for evaluating the company's financial performance."
