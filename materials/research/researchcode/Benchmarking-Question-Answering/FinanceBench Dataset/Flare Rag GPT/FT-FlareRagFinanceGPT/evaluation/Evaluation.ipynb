The quick ratio is a measure of a company's ability to meet its short-term financial obligations with its most liquid assets. A ratio of 1 or higher is generally considered healthy, so 3M's quick ratio suggests that the company has enough liquid assets to cover its short-term liabilities.

However, it is important to note that operating margin may not be the most useful metric for a company like Adobe, as it is a software company that relies heavily on research and development and marketing expenses.
