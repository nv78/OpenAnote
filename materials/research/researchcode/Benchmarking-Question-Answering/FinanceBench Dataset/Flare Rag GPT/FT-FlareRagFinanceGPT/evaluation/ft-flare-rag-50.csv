"Yes, based on the data provided, it appears that 3M is a capital-intensive business as they have a significant amount of property, plant, and equipment and invest a large amount in purchasing additional assets each year. This is also supported by the fact that they have consistently increased their dividend for 65 consecutive years, indicating a stable and profitable business model. ","No, the company is managing its CAPEX and Fixed Assets pretty efficiently, which is evident from below key metrics:

"3M's operating margin change as of FY2022 may have been driven by a variety of factors, such as changes in revenue, expenses, or overall market conditions.
