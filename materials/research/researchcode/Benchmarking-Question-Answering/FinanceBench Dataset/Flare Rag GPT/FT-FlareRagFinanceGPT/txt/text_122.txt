Note 3 â€” Restructuring and Impairment Charges
2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan
We publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan) that will leverage newtechnology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market andinformation systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize ourmanufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in the fourthquarter of 2022, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities withinthe initiatives described above.
As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.65 billion, including cashexpenditures of approximately $2.9 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately
55% of severance andother employee-related costs, 10% for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions and 35%for other co
sts associated with the implementation of our initiatives.
