“We are very pleased with our performance and business momentum as our categories and
geographies remained resilient during the first quarter. Given our strong start to the year, we
now expect our full-year 2023 organic revenue to increase 8 percent (previously 6 percent) and
core constant currency EPS to increase 9 percent (previously 8 percent),” said Chairman and
CEO Ramon Laguarta.
