Derivative Instruments 
We enter into derivative transactions primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 
We employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including interest rate swaps, cross currency 
swaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, interest rate caps, swaptions and foreign exchange forwards. We do not hold 
derivatives for trading purposes.
