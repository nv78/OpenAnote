A. Acquisitions
Trillium
On November 17, 2021, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock not already owned by Pfizer of Trillium, a clinical stage
immuno-oncology company developing therapies targeting cancer immune evasion pathways and specific cell targeting approaches, for a
price of $18.50 per share in cash, for total consideration of $2.0 billion, net of cash acquired. As a result, Trillium became our wholly owned
subsidiary. We previously held a 2% ownership investment in Trillium. Trilliumâ€™s lead program, TTI-622, is an investigational fusion protein that
is designed to block the inhibitory activity of CD47, a molecule that is overexpressed by a wide variety of tumors.
We accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset, TTI-622, represented substantially all of the fair value of the
gross assets acquired, which exclude cash acquired. At the acquisition date, we recorded a $2.1 billion charge representing an acquired
IPR&D asset with no alternative future use in Research and development expenses, of which the $2.0 billion net cash consideration is
presented as a cash outflow from operating activities. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $256 million of assets acquired primarily
consisting of cash and investments. Liabilities assumed were approximately $81 million.
Array
On July 30, 2019, we acquired Array, a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and
commercialization of targeted small molecule medicines to treat cancer and other diseases of high unmet need, for $48 per share in cash. The
total fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.2 billion ($10.9 billion, net of cash acquired). In addition, $157 million in payments to
Array employees for the fair value of previously unvested stock options was recognized as post-closing compensation expense and recorded
in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (see Note 3). We financed the majority of the transaction with debt and the
balance with existing cash.___FINANCEBENCH_DELIMITER___Therachon
On July 1, 2019, we acquired all the remaining shares of Therachon, a privately-held clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on rare
diseases, with assets in development for the treatment of achondroplasia, a genetic condition and the most common form of short-limb
dwarfism, for $340 million upfront, plus potential milestone payments of up to $470 million contingent on the achievement of key milestones in
the development and commercialization of the lead asset. We accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset
represented substantially all the fair value of the gross assets acquired. The total fair value of the consideration transferred for Therachon was
$322 million, which consisted of $317 million of cash and our previous $5 million investment in Therachon. In connection with this asset
acquisition, we recorded a charge of $337 million in Research and development expenses.
