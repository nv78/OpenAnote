For the Full Year of Fiscal 2022
Net sales increased 18.3% to $10.2 billion compared to $8.6 billion in fiscal 2021,
primarily due to the favorable impact from the continued resilience of the beauty
category, retail price increases, the impact of new brands and product innovation,
increased social occasions, and fewer COVID-19 limitations compared to fiscal 2021.
Comparable sales increased 15.6% compared to an increase of 37.9% in fiscal 2021,
driven by a 10.8% increase in transactions and a 4.3% increase in average ticket.
Gross profit increased 20.1% to $4.0 billion compared to $3.4 billion in fiscal 2021. As
a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 39.6% compared to 39.0% in fiscal
2021, primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, strong growth in other revenue, and
favorable channel mix shifts, partially offset by higher inventory shrink and lower
merchandise margin.
SG&A expenses increased 16.2% to $2.4 billion compared to $2.1 billion in fiscal
2021. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 23.5% compared to
23.9% in fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower marketing expenses and leverage of
incentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of corporate
overhead due to strategic investments and deleverage of store payroll and benefits
due to wage investments.
