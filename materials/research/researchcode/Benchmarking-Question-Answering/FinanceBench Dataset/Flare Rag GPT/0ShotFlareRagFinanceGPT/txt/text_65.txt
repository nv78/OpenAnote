We must minimize disruption caused by production changes, achieve operational stability and implement productivity improvements in order to
meet customer demand and maintain our profitability. We have previously announced plans to adjust production rates on several of our
commercial aircraft programs. The 787 program is currently producing at low rates and we expect to gradually increase to 5 per month in 2023.
Production of the 777X is currently paused and is expected to resume in 2023. The 737 program has experienced operational and supply chain
challenges stabilizing production at 31 per month. We plan to gradually increase 737 production rates based on market demand and supply
chain capacity.
