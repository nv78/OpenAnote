Usual and Customary Pricing Litigation
The Company and certain current and former directors and officers are named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits that allege that the Company’s retail
pharmacies overcharged for prescription drugs by not submitting the correct usual and customary price during the claims adjudication process.___FINANCEBENCH_DELIMITER___The Company is facing multiple lawsuits, including by state Attorneys General, governmental subdivisions and several putative class actions, regarding drug
pricing and its rebate arrangements with drug manufacturers. These complaints, brought by a number of different types of plaintiffs under a variety of legal
theories, generally allege that rebate agreements between the drug manufacturers and PBMs caused inflated prices for certain drug products.___FINANCEBENCH_DELIMITER___In December 2022, the Company agreed to a formal settlement agreement, the financial amounts of which were agreed to in principle in October 2022, with a
leadership group of a number of state Attorneys General and the Plaintiffs’ Executive Committee (“PEC”). The agreement would resolve substantially all
opioid claims against Company entities by states and political subdivisions, but not private plaintiffs. The maximum amount payable by the Company under the
settlement would be approximately $4.3 billion in opioid remediation and $625 million in attorneys’ fees and costs and additional remediation. The amounts
would be payable over 10 years, beginning in 2023.
