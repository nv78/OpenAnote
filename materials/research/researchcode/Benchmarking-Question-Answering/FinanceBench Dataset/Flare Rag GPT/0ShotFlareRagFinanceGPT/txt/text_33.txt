Net
revenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64%
increase in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYCâ„¢ server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue
primarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion
of Xilinx embedded product sales.
