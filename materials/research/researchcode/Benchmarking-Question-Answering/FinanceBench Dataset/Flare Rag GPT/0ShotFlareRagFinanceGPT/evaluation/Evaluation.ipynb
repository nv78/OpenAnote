However, it's important to note that operating margin may not always be the most useful metric for evaluating a company's financial performance. This is because it only takes into account a company's operating income and does not consider other important factors such as taxes, interest, and non-operating expenses.

It appears that the Industrial segment has been the main factor in dragging down 3M's overall growth in 2022, as it has experienced a decline in sales and profitability.

The quick ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term financial obligations with its most liquid assets. A ratio of 1 or higher is generally considered healthy, so 3M's quick ratio suggests that it has enough liquid assets to cover its short-term liabilities.
