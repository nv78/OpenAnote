The company had a total revenue of $8.6 billion and an adjusted operating income of $3.2 billion for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2016. To calculate the year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income, we need to subtract the prior-year's operating income from the current-year's operating income and then divide it by the total revenue.

This was due to a decrease in sales volume combined with an increase in manufacturing costs. As JNJ is a healthcare company that generates revenue primarily through product sales, the company has struggled to maintain profitability amidst rising healthcare costs and competition from other companies offering similar products. Additionally, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has further impacted JNJ's financial performance due to disruptions in supply chains and reduced demand for certain products. \n",
