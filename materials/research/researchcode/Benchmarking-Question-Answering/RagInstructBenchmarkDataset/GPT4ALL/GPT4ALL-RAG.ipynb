      "I am sorry, but I do not have access to the latest information regarding Barclay's updated rating on UTZ. However, I can provide you with a general overview of how equity analysts set price targets for companies they cover. They typically use a combination of fundamental analysis and technical analysis to determine the fair value of a company's shares. This includes analyzing the company's financial statements, industry trends, and macroeconomic factors that could impact its performance. Once this information is gathered, analysts will create a price target range based on their expectations for the company's future performance. The upper end of the range represents the highest possible price the analyst believes the stock will reach in the next 12 months, while the lower end represents the lowest possible price. It's important to note that these targets are subject to change as new information becomes available and can vary widely depending on individual analyst opinions and assumptions.\n",

The term \"AI\" itself dates back to the 1950s when it was coined by John McCarthy, a computer scientist at Stanford University. However, the first major breakthrough in AI came with the development of the Lisp programming language in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which allowed for more complex algorithms and machine learning techniques. Since then, there have been many other important developments and milestones in AI research, including the creation of the first artificial general intelligence (AGI) system in the mid-2000s, the development of deep learning algorithms that can perform complex tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing, and the emergence of new technologies like robotics and autonomous vehicles.\n",
