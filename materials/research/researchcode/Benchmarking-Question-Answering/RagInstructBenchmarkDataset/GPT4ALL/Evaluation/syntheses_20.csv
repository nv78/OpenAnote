When was the field of AI founded?,1956,"The study of mechanical or 'formal' reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as '0' and '1', could simulate both mathematical deduction and formal reasoning, which is known as the Church–Turing thesis.  This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics and information theory, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an 'electronic brain'.  The first paper later recognized as 'AI' was McCullouch and Pitts design for Turing-complete 'artificial neurons' in 1943.  The field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956.","
AI is a broad and interdisciplinary field that has roots dating back to ancient civilizations. However, the modern era of AI began in the mid-20th century with the development of the first artificial intelligence systems by John McCarthy and his colleagues at Dartmouth College. These early systems were designed to mimic human thinking and decision making, and their successors have since become a ubiquitous part of our daily lives. So, the field of AI was founded in the 1950s."

The Church-Turing thesis states that any problem that can be solved by a computer program can also be solved by a human being using logic and reasoning. This means that the capabilities of computers are limited only by their programming, while the same cannot be said for humans. It is considered one of the most important philosophical statements in computer science."

What is an AI winter?,A period when obtaining funding for AI projects is difficult.,"The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s.

An AI winter refers to a period of time when there is a lack of interest or funding for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) projects due to concerns about safety and ethical considerations. This can happen due to various reasons such as regulatory changes, economic downturns, or technological advancements that make existing AI systems obsolete. The AI winter typically lasts for several years before the market picks up again with new ideas and innovations."

Herbert Simon predicted that the increasing complexity of systems would lead to a decrease in their reliability and that the ability to handle complex problems would become increasingly important. He also believed that the use of computers would greatly increase the amount of information available for analysis, but that this would require new methods of inquiry. Additionally, he emphasized the importance of designing institutions and organizations to be adaptable and flexible in response to changing circumstances."

To calculate the increase in professional visualization revenue quarter-to-quarter, you will need to look at the previous and current quarters' revenue numbers. You can then subtract the previous quarter's revenue from the current quarter's revenue to find the percentage increase. For example, if the professional visualization revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was $500,000 and the second quarter of 2021 was $600,000, then the increase in revenue would be:

(600,000 - 500,000) / 500,000 = 10%

What is a list of all of the people mentioned?,"•Herbert Simon;
•Marvin Minsky;
•Sir James Lighthill;
•Papert.","The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s.  They and their students produced programs that the press described as 'astonishing': computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.  By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense and laboratories had been established around the world. Herbert Simon predicted, 'machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do'.  Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, 'within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved'. They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem.  Both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects. Minsky's and Papert's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks approach would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether.  The 'AI winter', a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.  In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems, a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research.

By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense and laboratories had been established around the world. Herbert Simon predicted, 'machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do'.  Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, 'within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved'.

Why did the intraday reversal occur?,"Traders were unclear of the reason, but some noted it could be the softer wage numberin the jobs report.","Stocks rallied Friday even after the release of stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs data and a major increase in Treasury yields.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 195.12 points, or 0.76%, to close at 31,419.58. The S&P 500 added 1.59% at 4,008.50. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1.35%, closing at 12,299.68. The U.S. economy added 438,000 jobs in August, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected 273,000 jobs. However, wages rose less than expected last month.  Stocks posted a stunning turnaround on Friday, after initially falling on the stronger-than-expected jobs report. At its session low, the Dow had fallen as much as 198 points; it surged by more than 500 points at the height of the rally. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 slid by 0.8% during their lowest points in the day.  Traders were unclear of the reason for the intraday reversal. Some noted it could be the softer wage number in the jobs report that made investors rethink their earlier bearish stance. Others noted the pullback in yields from the day’s highs. Part of the rally may just be to do a market that had gotten extremely oversold with the S&P 500 at one point this week down more than 9% from its high earlier this year.  Yields initially surged after the report, with the 10-year Treasury rate trading near its highest level in 14 years. The benchmark rate later eased from those levels, but was still up around 6 basis points at 4.58%.  'We’re seeing a little bit of a give back in yields from where we were around 4.8%. [With] them pulling back a bit, I think that’s helping the stock market,' said Margaret Jones, chief investment officer at Vibrant Industries Capital Advisors. 'We’ve had a lot of weakness in the market in recent weeks, and potentially some oversold conditions.'","
The intraday reversal occurred due to a variety of factors such as market participants adjusting their positions based on recent events or changes in market sentiment. It could also be related to the company's financial performance, industry trends, or macroeconomic conditions. Additionally, it may indicate a potential trend change or shift in investor sentiment towards the stock."
