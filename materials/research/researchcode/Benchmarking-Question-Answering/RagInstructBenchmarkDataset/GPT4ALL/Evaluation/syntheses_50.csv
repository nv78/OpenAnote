To determine the improvement in operating income year-to-year, you will need to review the company's 10-K document and specifically look for the section that discusses ""Operating Income."" This information should be available under the heading ""Revenue"" or ""Expenses,"" depending on how the company reports its financial results. The improvement in operating income year-to-year can be calculated by subtracting the prior year's operating income from the current year's operating income, and then dividing that result by two. For example, if a company had $10 million in operating income in 2019 and $15 million in operating income in 2020, the improvement would be: ($10 million - $15 million) / 2 = $5 million."

When was the field of AI founded?,1956,"The study of mechanical or 'formal' reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as '0' and '1', could simulate both mathematical deduction and formal reasoning, which is known as the Church–Turing thesis.  This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics and information theory, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an 'electronic brain'.  The first paper later recognized as 'AI' was McCullouch and Pitts design for Turing-complete 'artificial neurons' in 1943.

The field of AI (Artificial Intelligence) is not a specific date or event that marked its founding. Instead, it has been evolving and growing since ancient civilizations such as the Babylonians and Egyptians developed early forms of intelligence in their societies. However, the modern era of AI began in the mid-20th century with the development of machine learning algorithms and computer programming languages."

An AI winter refers to a period of time when there is a lack of interest or funding for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies due to concerns about safety and ethical considerations. It is often characterized by a slowdown in progress, reduced experimentation, and a shift towards more focused research areas. The term was first coined during the dot-com bust of the late 1990s when there were concerns about the potential risks associated with AI development."

Herbert Simon predicted that the ability of individuals or organizations to solve problems would depend on the availability and quality of their information resources.

Additionally, he argued that the design of complex systems could have a significant impact on their success or failure, and that understanding this process was crucial for designing effective solutions."

•Sir James Lighthill;
•Papert.","The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s.  They and their students produced programs that the press described as 'astonishing': computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.  By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense and laboratories had been established around the world. Herbert Simon predicted, 'machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do'.  Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, 'within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved'. They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem.  Both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects. Minsky's and Papert's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks approach would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether.  The 'AI winter', a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.  In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems, a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research. However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.","10-K documents typically include a list of all individuals who are named as executive officers or directors of the company.

3. Japan.","The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s.  They and their students produced programs that the press described as 'astonishing': computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.  By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense and laboratories had been established around the world. Herbert Simon predicted, 'machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do'.  Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, 'within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved'. They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem.  Both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects. Minsky's and Papert's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks approach would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether.  The 'AI winter', a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.  In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems, a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research. However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.","

Why did the intraday reversal occur?,"Traders were unclear of the reason, but some noted it could be the softer wage numberin the jobs report.","Stocks rallied Friday even after the release of stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs data and a major increase in Treasury yields.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 195.12 points, or 0.76%, to close at 31,419.58. The S&P 500 added 1.59% at 4,008.50. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1.35%, closing at 12,299.68. The U.S. economy added 438,000 jobs in August, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected 273,000 jobs. However, wages rose less than expected last month.  Stocks posted a stunning turnaround on Friday, after initially falling on the stronger-than-expected jobs report. At its session low, the Dow had fallen as much as 198 points; it surged by more than 500 points at the height of the rally. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 slid by 0.8% during their lowest points in the day.  Traders were unclear of the reason for the intraday reversal. Some noted it could be the softer wage number in the jobs report that made investors rethink their earlier bearish stance. Others noted the pullback in yields from the day’s highs. Part of the rally may just be to do a market that had gotten extremely oversold with the S&P 500 at one point this week down more than 9% from its high earlier this year.  Yields initially surged after the report, with the 10-year Treasury rate trading near its highest level in 14 years. The benchmark rate later eased from those levels, but was still up around 6 basis points at 4.58%.  'We’re seeing a little bit of a give back in yields from where we were around 4.8%. [With] them pulling back a bit, I think that’s helping the stock market,' said Margaret Jones, chief investment officer at Vibrant Industries Capital Advisors. 'We’ve had a lot of weakness in the market in recent weeks, and potentially some oversold conditions.'","
