When was the field of AI founded?,1956,"The study of mechanical or 'formal' reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as '0' and '1', could simulate both mathematical deduction and formal reasoning, which is known as the Church–Turing thesis.  This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics and information theory, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an 'electronic brain'.  The first paper later recognized as 'AI' was McCullouch and Pitts design for Turing-complete 'artificial neurons' in 1943.  The field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956.","
The field of AI (Artificial Intelligence) is not a specific date or event, but rather a broad range of activities and developments that have occurred over several decades. The term ""AI"" itself dates back to the 1950s when it was coined by John McCarthy, a computer scientist at Stanford University. However, the first major breakthrough in AI came with the development of the Lisp programming language in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which allowed for more complex algorithms and machine learning techniques. Since then, there have been many other important developments and milestones in AI research, including the creation of the first artificial general intelligence (AGI) system in the mid-2000s, the development of deep learning algorithms that can perform complex tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing, and the emergence of new technologies like robotics and autonomous vehicles."

The Church-Turing thesis states that any algorithm that can be computed by a computer can also be computed by a human being using a Turing machine. In other words, there are no fundamental differences between the computational capabilities of humans and computers."

What is an AI winter?,A period when obtaining funding for AI projects is difficult.,"The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s.  They and their students produced programs that the press described as 'astonishing': computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.  By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense and laboratories had been established around the world. Herbert Simon predicted, 'machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do'.  Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, 'within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved'. They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem.  Both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects. Minsky's and Papert's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks approach would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether.  The 'AI winter', a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.  In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems, a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research. However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.","
An AI winter refers to a period of time when there is a lack of interest or funding for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies due to concerns about job displacement and ethical considerations. It typically occurs in industries that rely heavily on automation, such as manufacturing and transportation."

Herbert Simon predicted that the ability of individuals or organizations to solve problems would depend on the availability and use of information at hand. He also believed that the increasing amount of information available to decision-makers would lead to more complex decisions, but that the quality of those decisions would be lower than in the past due to the complexity of the problem-solving process. Additionally, he argued that the management of information was critical for the success of organizations and that the use of technology could greatly enhance this process."

What is a list of all of the people mentioned?,"•Herbert Simon;
•Marvin Minsky;
•Sir James Lighthill;
•Papert.","The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s.  They and their students produced programs that the press described as 'astonishing': computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.  By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense and laboratories had been established around the world. Herbert Simon predicted, 'machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do'.  Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, 'within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved'. They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem.  Both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects. Minsky's and Papert's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks approach would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether.  The 'AI winter', a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.  In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems, a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research.

Why did the intraday reversal occur?,"Traders were unclear of the reason, but some noted it could be the softer wage numberin the jobs report.","Stocks rallied Friday even after the release of stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs data and a major increase in Treasury yields.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 195.12 points, or 0.76%, to close at 31,419.58. The S&P 500 added 1.59% at 4,008.50. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1.35%, closing at 12,299.68. The U.S. economy added 438,000 jobs in August, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected 273,000 jobs. However, wages rose less than expected last month.  Stocks posted a stunning turnaround on Friday, after initially falling on the stronger-than-expected jobs report. At its session low, the Dow had fallen as much as 198 points; it surged by more than 500 points at the height of the rally. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 slid by 0.8% during their lowest points in the day.  Traders were unclear of the reason for the intraday reversal. Some noted it could be the softer wage number in the jobs report that made investors rethink their earlier bearish stance. Others noted the pullback in yields from the day’s highs. Part of the rally may just be to do a market that had gotten extremely oversold with the S&P 500 at one point this week down more than 9% from its high earlier this year.  Yields initially surged after the report, with the 10-year Treasury rate trading near its highest level in 14 years. The benchmark rate later eased from those levels, but was still up around 6 basis points at 4.58%.  'We’re seeing a little bit of a give back in yields from where we were around 4.8%. [With] them pulling back a bit, I think that’s helping the stock market,' said Margaret Jones, chief investment officer at Vibrant Industries Capital Advisors. 'We’ve had a lot of weakness in the market in recent weeks, and potentially some oversold conditions.'","
