When was the field of AI founded?,1956,"The study of mechanical or 'formal' reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as '0' and '1', could simulate both mathematical deduction and formal reasoning, which is known as the Church–Turing thesis.  This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics and information theory, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an 'electronic brain'.  The first paper later recognized as 'AI' was McCullouch and Pitts design for Turing-complete 'artificial neurons' in 1943.

When was the first paper on AI published?,1943,"The study of mechanical or 'formal' reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as '0' and '1', could simulate both mathematical deduction and formal reasoning, which is known as the Church–Turing thesis.  This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics and information theory, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an 'electronic brain'.  The first paper later recognized as 'AI' was McCullouch and Pitts design for Turing-complete 'artificial neurons' in 1943.

Why did the intraday reversal occur?,"Traders were unclear of the reason, but some noted it could be the softer wage numberin the jobs report.","Stocks rallied Friday even after the release of stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs data and a major increase in Treasury yields.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 195.12 points, or 0.76%, to close at 31,419.58. The S&P 500 added 1.59% at 4,008.50. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1.35%, closing at 12,299.68. The U.S. economy added 438,000 jobs in August, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected 273,000 jobs. However, wages rose less than expected last month.  Stocks posted a stunning turnaround on Friday, after initially falling on the stronger-than-expected jobs report. At its session low, the Dow had fallen as much as 198 points; it surged by more than 500 points at the height of the rally. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 slid by 0.8% during their lowest points in the day.  Traders were unclear of the reason for the intraday reversal. Some noted it could be the softer wage number in the jobs report that made investors rethink their earlier bearish stance. Others noted the pullback in yields from the day’s highs. Part of the rally may just be to do a market that had gotten extremely oversold with the S&P 500 at one point this week down more than 9% from its high earlier this year.  Yields initially surged after the report, with the 10-year Treasury rate trading near its highest level in 14 years. The benchmark rate later eased from those levels, but was still up around 6 basis points at 4.58%.  'We’re seeing a little bit of a give back in yields from where we were around 4.8%. [With] them pulling back a bit, I think that’s helping the stock market,' said Margaret Jones, chief investment officer at Vibrant Industries Capital Advisors. 'We’ve had a lot of weakness in the market in recent weeks, and potentially some oversold conditions.'","The intraday reversal occurred due to a combination of factors, including a pullback in Treasury yields from their highs earlier in the session and some traders viewing the market as oversold after the recent weakness. The jobs report initially spooked investors with stronger than expected wage growth, but the pullback in wage growth later in the report caused some traders to reassess and close out their bearish positions. Technical factors like oversold conditions also likely contributed."

What events enabled the Democrats to win the Senate?,The electoral victories in Georgia by Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock.,"Though Biden was generally acknowledged as the winner, General Services Administration head Emily W. Murphy initially refused to begin the transition to the president-elect, thereby denying funds and office space to his team. On November 23, after Michigan certified its results, Murphy issued the letter of ascertainment, granting the Biden transition team access to federal funds and resources for an orderly transition. Two days after becoming the projected winner of the 2020 election, Biden announced the formation of a task force to advise him on the COVID-19 pandemic during the transition, co-chaired by former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, former FDA commissioner David A. Kessler, and Yale University's Marcella Nunez-Smith. On January 5, 2021, the Democratic Party won control of the United States Senate, effective January 20, as a result of electoral victories in Georgia by Jon Ossoff in a runoff election for a six-year term and Raphael Warnock in a special runoff election for a two-year term. President-elect Biden had supported and campaigned for both candidates prior to the runoff elections on January 5.On January 6, a mob of thousands of Trump supporters violently stormed the Capitol in the hope of overturning Biden's election, forcing Congress to evacuate during the counting of the Electoral College votes. More than 26,000 National Guard members were deployed to the capital for the inauguration, with thousands remaining into the spring.","The Democratic Party won control of the United States Senate as a result of electoral victories in Georgia by Jon Ossoff in a runoff election for a six-year term and Raphael Warnock in a special runoff election for a two-year term on January 5th, 2021.

The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as '0' and '1', could simulate both mathematical deduction and formal reasoning, which is known as the Church–Turing thesis.  This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics and information theory, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an 'electronic brain'.

•AI research at the time was funded heavily by the U.S. Department of Defense;
•Herbert Simon predicted that machines would be capable in 20 years of doing human work;
•Marvin Minskey predicted that AI would be substantially solved within a generation;
•Due to these under-estimations of the difficulty of the problem, reduced government funding, and concerns about the real-world use of neural networks, the 'AI winter' followed;
•AI research was revived in the 1980s with expert systems, and the market for AI reached over $1 billion in 1985;
However, with the collapse of the Lisp machine market in 1987, AI fell in disrepute again, and another AI winter ensued.","The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s.  They and their students produced programs that the press described as 'astonishing': computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.  By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense and laboratories had been established around the world. Herbert Simon predicted, 'machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do'.  Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, 'within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved'. They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem.  Both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects. Minsky's and Papert's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks approach would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether.  The 'AI winter', a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.  In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems, a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research. However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.","• AI research was heavily funded in the 1960s
