Data from Japan’s customs agency revealed that exports in September increased 4.3% year on year, while imports slid 16.3% compared to the same period last year. According to FactSet, exports to Asia fell for the ninth straight month, which reflected ongoing China weakness. Exports were supported by shipments to Western markets, FactSet added. — Lim Hui Jie
