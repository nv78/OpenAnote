Nokia said it would cut up to 14,000 jobs as part of a cost cutting plan following third quarter earnings that plunged. The Finnish telecommunications giant said that it will reduce its cost base and increase operation efficiency to â€œaddress the challenging market environment. The substantial layoffs come after Nokia reported third-quarter net sales declined 20% year-on-year to 4.98 billion euros. Profit over the period plunged by 69% year-on-year to 133 million euros.
