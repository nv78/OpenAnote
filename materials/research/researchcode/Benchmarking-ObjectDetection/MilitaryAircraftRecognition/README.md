# Military Aircraft Recognition Dataset

## Overview

The Military Aircraft Recognition dataset is designed for object detection and classification of military aircraft in aerial or satellite imagery. It provides annotated images to support research and development of algorithms for automatic aircraft detection, recognition, and tracking in remote sensing applications.

## Dataset Contents

- **Images:** Aerial or satellite images containing various types of military aircraft.
- **Annotations:** Bounding box annotations for each aircraft instance, including class labels.
- **Format:** All data is under [datafiles directory](materials\research\researchcode\Benchmarking-ObjectDetection\MilitaryAircraftRecognition\datafiles) split into training, validation, and test sets. All the images are in their respective directories, and annotations are provided in the CSV files (metadata.csv) with columns for image ID, bounding box coordinates, and class labels.
- **Original Annotations:** The original annotations are provided in the [original_annotations directory](materials\research\researchcode\Benchmarking-ObjectDetection\MilitaryAircraftRecognition\original_annotations), which includes the original annotations in their original format.
- **Link to Original Dataset:** The original dataset can be accessed from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khlaifiabilel/military-aircraft-recognition-dataset/data).
