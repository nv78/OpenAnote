# Military Aircraft Recognition Dataset

## Overview

The Military Aircraft Recognition dataset is designed for object detection and classification of military aircraft in aerial or satellite imagery. It provides annotated images to support research and development of algorithms for automatic aircraft detection, recognition, and tracking in remote sensing applications.

## Dataset Contents

- **Images:** Aerial or satellite images containing various types of military aircraft.
- **Annotations:** Bounding box annotations for each aircraft instance, including class labels.
- **Link to HuggingFace Repository:** The dataset is available on HuggingFace [anyaeross/MilitaryAircraftRecognition](https://huggingface.co/datasets/anyaeross/MilitaryAircraftRecognition)
- **Link to Original Dataset:** The original dataset can be accessed from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khlaifiabilel/military-aircraft-recognition-dataset/data).
