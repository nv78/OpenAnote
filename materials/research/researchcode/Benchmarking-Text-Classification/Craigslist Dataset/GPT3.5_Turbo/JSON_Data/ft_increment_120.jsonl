Buyer: I am, how much is a 2 bedroom, the ad doesn't specify bedrooms available Seller: our ad is actually the price for a 2 bedroom! it is 979 Buyer: Oh I see, and how much is a 1 bedroom? Seller: We only have 2 and 3 bedrooms available! Buyer: That's too bad, I'm on a tight budget.  Would you be willing to accept me for $600 per month?   Seller: There is unfortunately no way for me to lower the price that low but, what I can do for you is waive the pet deposit and give you 3 visits free to our pet spa. You can also save money by cancelling your gym membership since we have one on-site included in your monthly rent! Buyer: My budget will allow me to go up to $650 only but I have a proposition.  I own my own construction company.  I would be able to have my crew fix any repairs as long as I'm living there, FREE OF CHARGE!  That would save you hundreds, maybe thousands over the year!
