2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Amazon's batteries are great. I've had no problems with them leaking or corroding. They last as long as any other AA battery I've used too.The AmazonBasics brand has been great for so many different things, and I definitely recommend these batteries."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,always need batteries
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"It's pretty good for what it is designed to do: a portable bluetooth speaker and Alexa-enabled speaker. Not voice controlled so you have to touch the speaker button for Alexa. Nice thing once connected to your Alexa account is that you can play music, whatever, without having your phone nearby though Alexa only works when connected to WiFi. If no Wifi, then connect via bluetooth to play music from any apps. Battery life is also pretty good."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I love it it comes with a 12 month kids subscription
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"For the price, it is quite a nice tablet. I must admit there's little I've done with it for now, the goal being to get it to the kids to control their Lego Boost kit with it."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This tablet is good for kids but the battery life is not very long.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This was a great Christmas gift for my kid. This allows them to store their favorite books and play some educational games. Its nice to also have an optional MicroSD card for extra storage.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Great deal, thanks"
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Nice for the price had to put Google play store on myself but still a nice tablet
2,Health & Beauty,,4,These are a good buy.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"My father upgraded from the original Kindle Fire to this model, and he's very happy with it. It doesn't compete with more mainstream tablets, but he likes the Kindle's system for downloading library books."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Batteries came charged, I guess that's a good thing"
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and I do not regret my decision at all!The only con (for those evaluating this as a tablet) is that Amazon has their own App Store. Many apps from GooglePlay/AppStore are simply not available.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,Seems to be great but just need a little more time to play with it. The main user is nearly four years old. Happy with it and gets excited when using it.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Nice tablet at a very affordable price.............
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Fast delivery. Will order again
2,Health & Beauty,,1,These leaked battery acid twice over a two week person in LED lights which don't pull a lot of power. I will go for a brand name next time...I can't have my students getting burns from leaky batteries.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Really great love tge tablet really easy for my daughter, learning! I do wish it had more storage, and more items for kids. But we do love the tablet."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"If you already have the Amazon Echo system then the Tap is a nice addition. I use it primarily as an outdoor speaker for my patio when the weather is nice. There are Bluetooth speakers on the market with better sound quality but it does an adequate job as a speaker. The real advantage is being able to interface with the Echo system as well as item to music, news,etc. I have not used it off it's charger long enough to comment on battery life but so far a six hour session outside was no problem."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Best Product Value , Amazon know what they doing (:Good price for quantity , for sure will buy more ."
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,"This is a great little phone. It feels like a true moto phone. I like the pure experience of the software. While it's not on par with the $600+ phones... Dollar for dollar, it is well worth the cost. Definitely a good buy."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Excellent deal for 36 batteries. I have found the batteries do not last quite as long as Duracell or other brands. Not as noticeable in remotes or such but flashlights will drain them quickly. They are still an excellent deal though.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Does all basic functions of a tablet. Hardcore users may want an iPad.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Kids love it. Easy for them to use. Only issue is there is a ton of Ads that pop up.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Purchased this for our 8yo--she loves it! Had to return the 1st one after just.a few days as the screen would go black after typing in password--periodically. However, Best Buy traded it out for a new one!"
0,Electronics,2.0,0,"The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good Batteries
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"I had high hopes for these and very surprised at alt he high rating. I must have received a bad batch. This is a large qty and 6-8 months after purchase, using these batteries and they are no good. I figured they just wore out since i did not use them. Very disappointed and a good 20+ are trash. Real bummer."
0,Electronics,0.0,1,"My 5 year old dropped this from a standing position (about a foot off the ground) and it busted. I had to use the BB warranty to replace it the day after purchase for a fall that the tablet should've been able to handle that is designed for kids. I'm happy with the apps, but definitely not thrilled with the lack of protection that is designed for kids."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"With alot of kids and toys in the house we have been running through hundreds of batteries. Yes hundreds, no typo. I have found these batteries to have the perfect balance of cost vs longevity. They dont last the longest but theyre priced just right to make it worth it. I would recommend to anyone that needs batteries in bulk."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This is my first Fire Kindle. I love it. It is fast, and has good internet. It gives me quick access to all my Kindle library. I found out it's easier to scroll through the pages than when using Kindle Touch."
0,Electronics,0.0,1,I think the charging port should be something more simple since this product is aimed at smaller children. We‚Äôve only had ours for a month and the port is broke. Getting a new one sent to us.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,2,"Good features for kids, but definitely not enough storage. You'll need to get an SD card and set things to download to that or it will freeze and stop working."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Great for reading in the sunlight. As well as light, and easy on the wrist. Great product, but a little speedy."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Worked just fine for the price!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great quality
2,Health & Beauty,,4,good
2,Health & Beauty,,4,can never have too many batteries on hand
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Just what I needed.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,I have no issues with product. Daughter seems to love it
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Used it for watching television shows. The picture was clear and the audio was decent for the location of the speakers.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,My kids enjoy reading books and playing games on the fire tablet.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,excellent
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Am happy with my purchase and the item is being used by my brother's son and he is also happy as on dat
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Throw away all my generic batteries and replaced with these. 48-Pack came in a nice carton box with 4-pcs. battery in each plastic wrap. Used in remote controllers, game controllers, mouse, automatic spray air fresheners, LED flashlights and camping lanterns, clocks, wall lamps, and other devices. Excellent batteries for the price."
0,Electronics,0.0,0,"The Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet no longer was able to charge less than six months after being received as a Christmas present. I contaced Amazon, assuming that the was a one year warranty. Amazon tech support navigated me through a number of trouble shooting steps and concluded that the Usb port is defective. I was then told that this product only has a 90 day warranty and the best they could do in give me a 10% on my next Amazon purchase! Wow!"
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"they work well so far, cheaper than other batteries i have seen. hoping there wont be any leakage or anything."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I like that the tablet has child settings and time usage. Very helpful in setting time limits.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This is an amazing product for reading books and watching movies.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"i have been looking at tablets for a long time, most of them a little expensive for what i would use it for. This tablet lets me read, email, searches and the best part I can buy books through amazon and not have to carry heavy books with me when i travel"
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Good buy don't know how well they will last have to wait and see.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Easy to use reading device. Looking forward to watching movies on it. Great value
0,Electronics,0.0,3,It works nice. Still seems like ancient techonology compared to any apple product
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Nice sound for the money, good highs not much lows"
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This is my second Kindle and I am really enjoying it. I purchased mainly to use as a reader but it has exceeded my expectations. I can check my emails, surf the web, down loaded fb and pintrest as well. I have linked to my local library and can borrow books with ease. I have also downloaded Netflix as well. I love that I can change it to night reading so there is not so much of a strain on my eyes. I have not charged it for 2days now and have done quite a bit of reading and still showing 53%after 2 days. I purchased the 16g but plan on purchasing a micro SD card so I can expand the memory to download audio books as well."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Decent batteries
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"I put two of these batteries in my wireless mouse and in less than two hours use, they had burned up. The mouse quit working and I went to check the batteries and they literally burned my fingers trying to get them out. I will throw the rest of them away and NEVER buy these again.I know I'll never get my money back. I'll just write it off as a lesson learned."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Good batteries for the price
0,Electronics,1.0,3,"Not sure if this is due to the new version but I'm not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet. Amazon is really trying to lock out non-Amazon apps namely ones from Google. Aside from that though, performance is already and what you'd expect from a tablet in this price range. This was purchased for my mom and it does what's needed and my mom has no complaints thus far."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,she loves it she is 6yrs old and it fits her level well and she just loves it
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"These seem as good as top-tier brands and models.Using these on professional audio equipment... the equipment ran the same amount of time.I think the only difference, is they are vastly less expensive."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Bought for my son and he enjoys playing in it. He's able to download all the apps he wanted and the camera is awesome.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,Not fresh. Run down fast.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great
0,Electronics,12.0,3,"As abv, takes 3 + hours to fully charge. I hoped it would be much faster (maybe an hour), to the point that I had thought I got a lemon. People were kind enough to answer my question, and learned that I should not expect miracles, lol. Apart from that, good thing it comes with the cord, and is compact enough."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Simply great
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I got it at a great price. They price matched for me. Much faster then getting my laptop out to check email
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"These are good little batteries for the price. They come wrapped four to a shrink wrap pack, the rest of the box seems sturdy. I tested a few out of the box and they all show 1.5 volts as they should!"
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,Great tablet for destructive toddlers. My son has dropped and thrown it several times and it still works!...
0,Electronics,28.0,3,"My son loves it. It does have some flaws though. When he closes an app and then tries to open it again sometimes it has to download all over again. Also, even though apps are supposed to work without wifi, apps will load up fine and then we receive an error message saying we have to download the app again although the app is running perfectly in the background without wifi. Eventually all apps will disappear from the screen until we get back to wifi and restart the tablet."
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"Meh, they work, wud gladly pay more for USA made tho!"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,great stuff
2,Health & Beauty,,4,good
2,Health & Beauty,,4,thank you
2,Health & Beauty,,4,AA batteries worked perfectly out of the box!
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I have two kids and they both love it. Its also nice because it is already setup for them.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I like it because is very resistant . The only thing we didn't like is that sometimes it's kinda slow
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,1,"Got this for my 8yo daughter. A lot of the times it doesn't work, I have to restart it a lot, and it only has 3 apps that I added on it. It came with way too many pre-loaded apps, and the most annoying thing is that the kids profile is permanently horizontal. Not really worth the money for me, but at least she's playing her Inside Out bubble game on her own tablet instead of my IPad."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Bought this for my 8 year old in place of a Nabi that didn't work out of the package. Great basic tablet for this.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Is it just me, or is it a huge challenge keeping enough batteries on hand. It's easy just to order a bulk box of these rather than take a beating at retail price. I'm not sure they are up to Energizer or Duracell standards, but they do the job ok. No complaints so far."
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"This tablet overall is okay,there are few problems that i face with this tablet. Charging this tablet takes little longer than the average tabletSome of the application is not available through amazon store app"
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Good customer service during my quest to get a good deal and quality gadget.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Exactly what I needed at a great price.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Awful poor performance. My mouse ran for several weeks to several months from Duracells but have never gotten more that several days from these. Will not buy again.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"Last less than a quarter as long as even off-brand batteries such as Rayovac, creating a lot more waste. With name brand batteries my wireless keyboard would last almost a year these amazon branded batteries last only 2-3 months. If they weren't considered hazardous waste when spent I might have given them 2 stars on account of there low price, but when you consider how hard it is to dispose of batteries properly (and how much time you'll spend changing them out of your favorite devices) they're really not worth your time"
0,Electronics,0.0,2,The tablet is for my son who is 2. That being said I noticed blotches on the screen. Never returned it due to it not making a difference to my son. I will have to upgrade him in question few years anyway. The bumper is amazing.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,I'm sure they will meet my needs. Thanks.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,Nice cheap battery. Will not last as long as a regular brand battery. You can even feel the difference
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"These work as well as any big name brand batteries. I'm a heavy pc user since I work from home and I use a wireless mouse with my laptop. I can get weeks of use out of these without an issue. And even when the low battery light starts flashing on the mouse, I still get 2-3 days use out of them. Save your money, and buy these instead."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great price. Good Quality. No complaints.
0,"Electronics,Media",0.0,3,"This kindle is awesome. I love the design of it. Nothing software wise that was different than my other kindle but the way it's designed makes it much more comfortable and easier to read. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of the price. If it were cheaper, this kindle would have been five stars no doubt."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,My daughter like the tablet and she use the tabet everday
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Good Batteries, but not as long lasting as the Duracell batteries."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,good value.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I like this Kindle the only this is it does not read the books as good as my older Amazon Kindle Fire.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"Tried them in my amazon firestick remote and they failed to make the remote work. However, no batteries have made it work. Seems the Amazon firestick remote is the problem. In any event I am stuck with 8 batteries that I do not need."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Good kids tablet for games and videos but the charger is pretty annoying.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,These didn't last very long.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,These are batteries at a great price!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great value.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,no problems
0,Electronics,0.0,2,It's ok but I rather have bought Samsung Galaxy Tab
0,Electronics,0.0,3,We have an iPad but bought this for the kids unlimited prime content. We have enjoyed it and it has a lot that the iPad doesn't. The menu could be more friendly but I like the parental limits it has.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Great tablet use it for reading and email. Great price!
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,"this was a christmas present, for the nephew works good, he loves it"
0,Electronics,0.0,2,Bought this tablet for 8 year old. It holding up good & she loves it. She enjoys playimg her games & being able to get on the internet.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"When my husband and I bought our Kindle Fire 8, we went to Best Buy and asked questions as best we could. There are programs we apparently need to put create and edit documents and spreadsheets!! We did ask if it had those features and was told yes but I think we need to have a special app. Why isn't there a manual or step by step guide on getting the most use out of Kindle Fire 8. Can I get it online? Kindle Fire 8 fun to use but needs more info for customers. Can we go to a class at Best Buy? Thanks for any help."
0,Electronics,1.0,3,"If you want one of the most advanced alarm clocks on the market then this is your device!It works well. Calendar functions, plays radio, most podcasts, can order Domino's. But you have to be aware that most features require to some degree Amazon Prime membership. For example Spotify will not work unless it is a premium account."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,FOR THE PRICE....THEY ARE OK
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"This is a great deal on bulk batteries, they seem to last a reasonable amount of time. They do not seem to last as long as the big name brands (this is based on how long between battery changes for my xbox one controller) .but for the savings it's well worth it."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,these batteries are terrible very disappointed. i have purchased before great long lasting very powerful. i must have received a bad batch they don't last very long. i may not purchase again.
0,Electronics,1.0,3,This edition of the kindle fire is a great improvement over the last model I had. The battery life is much better and it charges faster. The only drawback I have experienced is that the operation is sometimes slow. But I attribute that to having a 200GB expansion chip.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,Bought one before for my son and now he's brother turned 2 years and I decided to get one for him. He enjoys his tablet and battery life is good and I installed the educational app he wanted.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,These batteries started leaking right out of the box.I threw them in the trash and went back to Duracell.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,works for the office
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Great batteries for the price.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,They work
2,Health & Beauty,,0,I updated my credit car d more than six weeks ago. I won't bother you in the future.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,don't last long. Replace batteries in my clock almost every 2 months.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"They are batteries, so can't say I love them! But I've had good results with Amazon's AA's so trying these now."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,You can't beat these batteries when it comes to price. My son has seemingly a million toys that require batteries and it's always handy to have some around when he leaves them on (thomas the train motorized engines). Buying these from Amazon saves me a lot of money vice buying them from a major retailer. Thanks Amazon!Pro: cheap and reliable
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good deal.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,So far so good.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"These are by far the WORST batteries I have ever purchased. I have previously purchased bulk batteries from other vendors. When I ran out of the previous batteries I thought would order more. When I saw that these were branded by Amazon I thought I could not lose...WRONG! As an example, when I put these batteries in a thermostat they are dead within a few days. I normally put batteries in this thermostat once a year...not every few days. 2nd Example: I put the batteries in a bluetooth mouse (normally batteries last a few months) and they are dead within a week.I don't know if I have a bad batch or what but they are TERRIBLE. Take this into account before you order."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"So far so good, I'll try and let folks know if they don't last as long as branded batteries."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I didn't need a super expensive tablet, I just needed a basic one for couple different apps I needed. This one works perfect. Need a basic tablet for Netflix or Hulu or Amazon this works great. But don't expect it to be Ipad."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,great buy
0,Electronics,0.0,1,Very difficult to connect to You Tube. Very frustrating
0,Electronics,2.0,3,The table is great just to experience what is available on a tablet without a hugh expense. I would recommend to others.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I'm new to tablets but this one is pretty easy to understand and use.There's a decent amounts of apps at start up, which can be good and bad."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Like that downloading books is fast. I am still learning features and have not explored other positives featured.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,0,This product wouldn't turn on nor charge and then store couldn't locate another one for me.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"3rd purchase of these AA from Amazon, all have expiration of 2027. Ones I've used thus far last as Long as name brands"
2,Health & Beauty,,3,hope they last long
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Great 1st tablet for my little nephew downloaded great games and after he dropped it twice still works and looks amazing lol
0,Electronics,0.0,3,We've had three of these Kindles. They are well built and you can't get the quality in a tablet from any other manufacturer. Amazon has great support with them.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Needed a new Kindle. Wasn't sure what one to choose. This one is GREAT!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,great
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Product as advertised. Arrived on time and in good condition. Good value! Will buy again.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Just batteries what can I say.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Batteries work perfectly. Only problem is the packaging is a little large. You will need to put them in a smaller container unless u have a ton of cupboard space.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Don't waste your money. They last about 2 days in a wii remote.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Bought for my 4 yr old as a Christmas present. I turned it on, and set it up. Pretty sure she will love it!"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This is the second one I have Purchased. I purchased the 16 MB version for less than 50.00. As long as you understand it is an Amazon product it a darn good Tablet for the money
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"WORKS AS WELL AS NAME BRAND BATTERIES, BUT COST A LOT LESS."
0,Electronics,0.0,2,I didn't do any in depth research on this particular tablet. The price and speed were good for what I wanted it for. My only con is not being able to clear the home screen of apps or relocate them so I can see my personal home screen picture.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,Need to have some computer savvy. Wound be much more helpful if it came with a simple basic instructions.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Was super easy to connect via Bluetooth - great sound, fun to use."
0,Electronics,0.0,0,"I bought this to replace a 3-year old Kindle Fire 7"" HDX that I had just dropped on the floor. I sort of panicked, so after doing a couple of hours of research I picked this tablet. Just to be on the safe side I got 16 additional GB of memory. I installed a couple of games (none of them memory hogs) and a cookbook app, in addition to downloading a couple of books and dictionaries. I can honestly say this is the slowest tablet I've ever had. Just rotating the screen takes 7-10 seconds, and that's if there's only one app open. Opening a book or magazine can take half a minute, and God help you if you want to switch between a recipe and a magazine while you're cooking! Amazon is obviously more concerned about showing you constant special offers and apps than having satisfied customers. Since there are no other Fire tablets available for whatever reason (maybe they're being discontinued?) I'll be replacing it with either an iPad or a Galaxy tablet."
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,Works great keeps a pretty good charge. My sign up for prime to get more bang for my buck but over all solid tablet
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"They're the same size as the batteries they replaced. Who knows if they last longer, have more power than others until they go dead Who remembers to come back and post that these batteries worked for one day more or less than the last set you had They're batteries, and they looked like they were cheap to me. If they melt a remote control or something, I'll try to remember to come back and letchall know."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Super!
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Batteries give you power!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Came in quickly and just what I needed.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Better than expected. Good quality and good price. Fast shipping.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Overall a nice product for traveling purposes Value for money
2,Health & Beauty,,4,great product just as described
0,Electronics,0.0,3,The screen is clear and tablet is faster than i expected. Great colors also!
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Great batteries! I have nothing negative I can say about this product. They work just as well as any name brand product you would buy off the shelf at any store except these are probably one quarter of the price.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"They are ok - I haven't had any arrive DOA, but they really don't seem to work for very long. In an Xbox One controller, they last about half the time that a set of duracells would. I don't think they're terrible, but I doubt I'll buy them again. You can frequently catch Duracells on Newegg at about 30 per 100. Yes, it's a bit more than the amazon basics per battery, but you'll get a lot more usage out of each pair."
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Loved the price but I found myself replacing them more quickly in items like the wall clocks and the remote controls. I like having a box of replacement batteries on hand in the house so these are fine for emergencies but I might want to invest in a brand that lasts a bit longer for things like smoke detectors or flashlights.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good quality
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good cheap batteries
0,"Electronics,Media",1.0,3,The Oasis has a very sleek design that is very comfortable in hand. The flat transition from screen to bezel is very attractive. Backlight is great and its nice to be able to have it adjust automatically or manually. Menus are easy to access an understand. Wifi works great. The print looks very nice and easy easy on the eyes. Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is due to the relatively high price.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Works good, has very nice screen brightness and resolution"
2,Health & Beauty,,2,ok for the price
2,Health & Beauty,,4,as expected
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Do not last as long as costco/kirkland equivalents.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"They are fine as far as I can tell. (These are probably a private label version of a major brand.) I am counting on the Amazon brand in assuming they are identical to batteries from other brands. Good price, of course. The 5 stars really reflect my trust of Amazon."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,the batteries were fine.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Inconsistent. VERY short life.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,good value for price
2,Health & Beauty,,3,They're batteries. Significantly more cost effective than Duracel Energizer. Rated 4* because I can't yet say how they last compared to the two big brands but so far they're performing well.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Batteries seem to last a good amount of time and I received all of them in this pack unlike the AAA pack I bought from Amazon which was missing four batteries.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"It is a tablet. Downloads kids apps fast. Only complaint is when I shut it down the kid's user screen goes away. I do pull it back up but both my child and I get annoyed. Some regular apps I have not been able to remove from the regular screen. However, I would recommend."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,What a massive batch of batteries! This beats prices even the big box stores have.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,These batteries are a great value.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Got this for my teenage son (17) so that he could give his eyes and neck a rest from looking at media on his iPhone 7+ He totally loved it!
0,Electronics,2.0,0,"I bought 2 of the Amazon Fire tablets because the sales guy said that they were great and ran really fast. I have very fast internet and this thing just barely chugs along. If you play a game, it constantly stalls and freezes. The sound quality when I play music is terrible. I was planning on buying one for each of my 9 nieces and nephews if they ran well but now I know that wouldn't work for them because they are horrible."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Excellent batteries.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,When it works it's great but for some reason it doesn't always answer me When it doesn't answer me I turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn't work at that time. It was easy to set up with the phone app. Doesn't seem to matter where the phone is when it isn't working. I've tried close and far and in between. So a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn't
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,Very good product that I purchased for my godson. The only issue is the charger / charging port is having some difficulties. Will be bringing back to the store to have it looked at. My just be my 2 year old godson being a kid with it :) He loves it otherwise.

2,Electronics,,3,"Every other laptop cooler I have purchased has a USB plug to run a fan. Got tired of the fans making noise, the USB or cooler plug not working eventually etc.So gave this one a shot and it does what it says plus. Keeps my 15.6 Mac book pro cool and my legs are not heating up any more when sitting on the couch. Also the bottom does not feel nearly as hot as it used to. So why only 4 stars. The two tabs to keep your laptop from sliding off are not adjustable so when you are typing your arms want to rest on those tabs. Really uncomfortable. So in the pictures you can see a slight modification I made to alleviate this problem. I now rest the laptop on the pads so when typing my arms are resting on the key board portion as if the tabs were not there. Much more comfortable. I used strips of thick felt with sticky bottoms. Certainly not a technical fix but does the job. All they had to do was include a metal piece retrofit on the bottom portion that would allow you to raise your computer to a level so the tabs would not interfere. Simple but maybe on the next model. Check out the two photos."

2,Health & Beauty,,0,Might as well be dead on arrival. Already burned through two sets of 4 of these since I ordered them less than two months ago on a Schlage keypad deadbolt lock. The previous batteries lasted over a year. I'll never order another Amazon basics battery.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,No reason to buy more expensive batteries.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,Many batteries do not have full capacity. I read each with a meter before using. Often find one at .8 volt or below. I won't buy again.
2,Electronics,,2,"This bag does not fit my 17-inch laptop, although mine is a little bigger than many. You would need a relatively thin 17-inch laptop to make this work. Also, as some other reviewers described, it has a cheap-feeling inner lining. I also do not like that the zippers for the main pocket do not extend toward the base farther, so this does not open as wide as I would like. It will get the job done and serves as a replacement for my previous backpack, which was falling apart, but I do not think I would really recommend it to anyone."

2,Health & Beauty,,2,"They didn't last very long in my cheap camera. With them not being lithium I didn't expect them to last forever, but I should of gotten more then a days use out of them. In my Xbox controller they lasted an adequate amount of time. So all in all these definitely aren't for heavy use and the price point reflects that."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,My daughter loves this tablet. She can navigate through the apps with ease.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Amazon Basics - you are my hero. These are great batteries. I use them in my Apple keyboard and mouse and they have outlasted the brandname batteries I used to use. I get on average an additional 1-2 weeks of use out of each set of batteries which is an additional money saver. The shelf life seems to be normal for alkaline batteries.The packaging is biodegradable which adds to the convenience and value.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,A battery is a battery these work just as good if not better than the name brands like Duracell or Enginzer

2,Health & Beauty,,4,good price
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"I purchased them thinking they would be a great value, based on other reviews. I have an alarm keypad (among other things) that I use them in. Previously batteries would last about a year in the keypad. These batteries will last about a month before they die. The first time it happened, I thought there could have been a bad battery or possibly my memory was failing me. After 3 sets in 3 months, there is no doubt. The batteries test fully charged when I install them and then a month later they are gone. That is not a great value at all. I will find another battery for future use."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,as good maybe in some cases better than the bunny batteries.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Very functional for a tablet and e-reader. This was a purchase for my stepmom who broke her previous Kindle. She likes it because the screen is big, ease of use, and you can access the internet. The kids side is good too for the kids but some of the apps like YouTube and YouTube Kids will not play on this because it's an Amazon operating system. Overall I would recommend this to people who like the regular e-readers and want a tablet."
0,"Electronics,Media",0.0,3,"I purchased the Kindle Oasis because I was growing increasingly tired of the glare and cumbersome size of reading off my iPad. So the portability is great. And of course, I went for the most expensive, because I wanted the extra battery life. And while the length of time it stays charged is nice, charges very quickly, it's still overpriced. I love the non-glare screen, you can literally read this anywhere. But the wifi connectivity is patchy at best. I have to go upstairs in my home and stand close to the router for the Oasis to connect, this is very annoying. Wouldn't be a big deal if I only read from this one device. But I read from another and picking up where I left off is a pain most times. Non of my issues are really a big deal, but for $300 I don't feel like I should have any issues."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,These batteries are awesome for kids toys that don't have moving parts and only music. Also works great in remotes and things like that. Great value for what you get. Would definitely recommend to a friend.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"Not a very good battery. They drain really fast. I use them in my Roku remote. I plug my headphones into the remote for wireless listening, so I'm not sure if that is a factor. But I've used several different batteries in the remote and none of them drained nearly as quick as these did. I'm talking a week and they are dead. I would not recommend them."
0,"Electronics,Media",16.0,3,"I got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed. cover doesn't have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,I was expecting better battery life cause they claim 6weeks of battery life. I am getting 3weeks. I wish it was little better than that. But that's my only issue
2,Health & Beauty,,4,I tested the lifespan of these batteries with my Wireless mouse. Lasts just as long as Duracell CopperTop AAA.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,These are great batteries and they are real light on the pocket book compared to other National brands!
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This was an impulse buy. While getting a bigger, faster and much better tablet for my wife I decided I'd get this for myself. It did the job just fine, but after about a week I returned it. I just didn't find myself using it wnough to warrant keeping it. The price is awesome and if you don't mind it being a bit slower than other, much more expensive, tablets then I don't think you can go wrong."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,No complaints. Works just as good and lasts just as long as the name brands. They will give a pink bunny a run for his money.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Still evaluating, but just bought some more because they work well with my applications and their price is the best."
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,I don't encourage a lot of TV watching so the Amozon Fire was a good substitute. It's great for travel. My granddaughter plays games as she learns.

2,Health & Beauty,,0,I need batteries that register 1.5V out of the box my camera flash remotes depend on it! NONE of the batteries I tested were more than 1.3V fresh out of the box. Unacceptable! Spend a few more bucks and get some decent name brand batteries. These are pathetic. Anyone need a 20-pack of 1.3V batteries
2,Health & Beauty,,0,very cheap batteries
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"Bought these because I had heard from several sources that alkaline batteries are one of those items that you can buy as generics and get comparable quality to name brands. It is not unusual for me to keep batteries in storage for more than a year without a problem with leakage. These, after a year, would begin leaking soon after installing them. That is, they come out of their protective wrap looking brand new but would leak within days. They fouled up a few things, one of which was a good work flashlight. I hadn't seen a battery leak in decades. I had to throw out the remaining ones even though they looked deceptively good."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great Value. I'm sure Anazon doesn't have a battery company.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I purchased my Voyage yesterday. It looked like I scratched the screen today and I contacted Amazon directly and they replaced my Voyage under the warentee I did not need to go thru bestbuy. Turns out it was food and not a scratch and canceled the replacement but point is Amazon backs up their products! I do not think its worth 199$ for there is a weird screen discoloration where the top appears orangeish and the bottom blueish but only under certain lighting conditions BUT its barely noticeable. In normal light it looks quite normal. Due to cost it will be a great first purchase but no real need to upgrade from paperwhite BUT in its defense the Voyage is much much lighter, thinner and more responsive and the page turn buttons are seamless. Over all this is a mighty nice product. Side note: I own a Nook glow-light plus which is cheaper and looks nicer and has a great feel to it as well. Nook glowlight plus is more stylish with the copperish color back and white textured front. The Voyage is attractive too BUT I think it will sell better if it had a "" two toned"" color Like maybe a white front and a colored back side. Voyage is much faster than the nook but prettymuch same features. I just feel Amazon can afford to make their product more stylish. Also best buy does not seem to offer and real choices for cases on their kindles and tablets. I had to order a cover at ebay."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This is a nice little tablet for the $60 I paid on black Friday. At the regular price I would probably have gone with something a little less restricted and without so much Amazon content. The lock screen ads aren't much of a problem, I understand Amazon sells these cheap and gets it back via ads, but the 15-20 Amazon apps are a little much. It would be easier to stomach if you could add the ones you want or remove the ones you don't. That said, I was able to install the Google Play store and this tablet does everything I need it to do. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the purchase. It's a nice new toy. One note: In the online photos the magenta looks purple. It's actually pink. If you like purple, get a black one and a purple case."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,amazing tablet for kids and also adults can switch out between kid accounts and also adult account
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"Pro: Relatively inexpensive, although I did end up waiting almost two weeks for delivery.Cons: High drop-out rate. They come in packs of four when used in Nikon cameras it's not uncommon to find after an hour of use that three of the cells have dropped to 1.48V while the fourth has dropped to...1.2V. They come out of the box within a hundredth of a volt of each other, so I'm guessing that either the electrochemistry is highly variable from cell to cell or there's a interesting failure mode under load."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Decent batteries price wise but don't seem to last as long as the name brand batteries and I assume these are actually some lower end name brand batteries that Amazon has their name stuck on them.

0,Electronics,3.0,3,I love this kindle. Faster than the paper white in how it responds to changing pages and/or books. The self adjusting light levels works very good in mine. Having the option on the frame to change pages is great but you have to press a little hard on the forward page button or it will do a backward change instead; this is the only reason why I don't give it a 5.I love this reader

0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,This was a great purchase and would definitely buy this again. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is a programmer glitch.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Same batteries for a cheaper price, yes please!"
0,Electronics,0.0,2,This is an older tablet. I probobly expected too much. If I'm going to deal with lagginess I prefer my ipad2.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"I have used these batteries in several items from flashlights to toys. I have found them less than adaquate for the items they were used in. In my flashlights, I have found they last with average use about 3 weeks. Not very good. For controllers like TV remotes, they last less than a month. They may be cheper in the short run but they become much more expensive in the long run. I will not buy them again and suggest paying a bit more and getting the name brand batteries."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"We must have gotten a defective lot, because these have caused every fire alarm in the house to sound within days of installing these batteries. Too late to return. So much for 10 year shelf life."

I say them because I'm on my 6th one maybe. It's my fault, really. I lose them very easily for some reason. Anyway, these batteries are average at best. I generally get copper tops or energizers and was looking for an economical equivalent. This isn't it. I find myself replacing the battery in my flashlight more often than I used to. These batteries might be ok for your tv remote or battery powered clock but I'd pass if you need them for anything you rely on."

0,Electronics,1.0,3,"As I reviewed different tablets, this tablet kept coming back as my best option for the items I was looking for. It IS a great tablet, but there are a few things I don't really like about it. I didn't realize that Amazon has it's OWN browser SILK. Everything even your banking info goes through Amazon. Not sure I like that. Also, items don't automatically close out when you leave a page and I have to frequently hit the button on the bottom and close out multiple items. It might just be that I am not THAT computer savoy, though I do know how to navigate my way around. Sometimes the touch feature just seems to freeze and won't recognize that I am attempting 'touch'. Lastly, the on/off button is right where you hold the tablet on the side, so I am often 'accidently' shutting it down. Most annoying! Overall, I am happy with my purchase and for the price I like it. Just wanted to point out the other items."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Works just as good as the name brand batteries.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,It's great to some extent but I was expecting more. It's unfortunate that it does not work with lots of apps. Perhaps I'm not using them correctly. I'm still learning.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"What's happened to batteries Duracell use to be the gold standard, until we had over 10 of them fail by leaking and destroying expensive medical equipment year after year. Costco batteries became our go-to batteries until last year 2015 when they started leaking, even on the shelf. Tried Eveready but price and quality varies as well. I trusted Amazon and love the price, packaging, convenience and no leaks. But they don't last half the time the others have. Some of the top reviews have stated the electrical case very, very well. And yes, we have some high current draw uses. But as my staff and Doctors have said to me: They're just batteries! Get us some decent batteries already! We go through dozens a week so price is going to matter but, paying top dollar still doesn't seem to save equipment or increase the usage time. It seems every manufacture is changing their product for cost and marketing so that you have to be an expert to properly match basic AA batteries to your specific use. Not cool!!"

0,Electronics,0.0,3,While it isn't the most powerful tablet on the market it does what it was designed to do. It gets on the social media sites and the internet. If you're expecting more from yoru tablet then don't look for one at this price. You'll need the more powerful ones that translate to bigger price tags.

The background light is not uniform- it is tinged yellow towards the top and blue towards the bottom of the device. For a $200 device thats unacceptable! How much that bothers u will be subjective and u wont notice it as much once u get into your book. The problem was present on all 3 devices I purchased (and returned), to the exact same degree. I kept the last one because it still is an awesome reader and it seems like its a production issue. Going through amazon reviews, various online forums- it seems to be present on a large number of devices if not all. Amazon refuses to address the issue, probably because they'll get sued or something for releasing a wonky product, like the iphone antenna problem bottom line- great device, but you have a high risk of receiving a unit with the gradient issue (youtube it if u cant visualize what I'm talking about, tons of videos out there describing it) . How bad it is seems to depend on your personal luck, or which batch your local bestbuy has stock from, and most importantly it will bother you / what youre willing to settle for. In my case, i hated it but there was no alternative- the pw2 seemed like a huge downgrade in a head to head comparison so i decided to keep my voyage and live with it. If thats a problem for you, wait for the 2015 edition. The pw1 had this issue apparently and it was addressed quietly by amazon in the pw2."

Amazon, please keep an eye on quality and have your manufacturer test and give you results periodically. They will often provide good samples for evaluation early in production and then lower quality later."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"I was super bummed about these! I purchased them exactly 3 months ago today. I only used 8 batteries when they arrived, and they have all started to die this week already. When I went to replace them, none of the unopened ones work! So to recap... they did not last long, and only 8 of them were even usable. Very disappointed as we are big Amazon users."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,"With some reservations these appear to be excellent batteries. I replaced some Duracell batteries in several LED flashlights with these and the light was much brighter with Amazon batteries (side by side testing, two identical flashlights). I am impressed. On the down side, the date (I supposed expiration date of shelf life) is almost impossible to read without a magnifying glass. It is very readable on Duracell batteries. These were 2025 dated, so obviously they are 10 years out, and that's very good, will surely use them up long before then. The packaging is simple, but more or less necessitates a container to store them as they will just fall all over the drawer once opened. In hard to read print on the batteries it says made in Indonesia. Not Japan as some reviews had thought might be the country of origin. BTW -- the Duracells AAA's I removed from my flashlight leaked badly and ruined the (expensive) flashlight. Therefore I am sticking with Amazon batteries for now."

2,Health & Beauty,,1,"They are batteries and they do work... but not for long. I pretty much base battery quality by how long they last in my wireless mouse. Generally I have to replace my home mouse every 5-6 months. I purchased these Amazon Basics AA Performance Alkaline batteries 3-1/2 months ago. In that time I've replaced my home mouse battery *3* times!! (The 3rd being yet again today.) My daughter has also gone through 2 batteries in her mouse as well (though she spends most of her time on her laptop with the touchpad).The shipping was fast and you get several batteries for a low cost, but I think a more economical way to go is to spend a little extra on name brand dependable batteries that last 2-3 times as long."

I have a couple of apps that run on my old Fire just fine but are extremely problematic on this one.

Only that the camera function is pretty useless what with its low quality and lack of autofocus, or focus at all for that matter, but I knew that going in. Battery lasts all day, which is awesome since I keep all my notes on it. Touch screen might not be as sensitive as one would like, but overall? It does the job and does it well."

0,Electronics,0.0,2,Good for beginners. Although you need to have a google account and a credit card to start up. For reading purposes only.
1,Electronics,,3,"Using this with my Samsung Galaxy Note. Overall works fine, even though I'm on Gingerbread and not 3.0. Slim and lightweight. Pairs instantly. Some specialty keys don't work, but I'm not concerned as its purpose is just to get in text. This keyboard is much faster than the on-screen keyboard for inputting text.However, Amazon does not sell a case for this keyboard. This is a perfect travel keyboard, but carrying it bare in my day bag concerned me. I did a LOT of searching for some kind of generic slip case that would fit. Nothing.Then I stumbled on the Domke protective wrap, which is just a square of padded material with Velcro at the corners. It's designed for wrapping cameras and lenses. The 11 square fit the keyboard perfectly. I took it down to a local tailor shop and for 3 they sewed up the long side of the square when folded over on itself and one of the short sides creating a slip case. The protective wrap has a soft felt-like side and a nylon side. I folded it with the soft side on the inside. Now I have a perfect slip case for the keyboard, and for just about 15 (12 for the wrap from Amazon and 3 for the sewing)."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This tablet is great considering how affordable it is! I mainly use it for reading, streaming shows, and listening to music. I do wish it was a true Android platform instead of the ""Amazon Android"" platform, but overall it's a great little tablet!"
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"These are great for the price! They do tend to die slightly faster than other batteries, but overall they are great for what you pay. I would recommend these to anyone looking for basic batteries. The come in a plastic wrap which is easy to open. The same can't be said about some battery brands."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,real good tuff
0,Electronics,15.0,3,"The Kindle will NEVER take the place of an iPad or Samsung Galaxy Tab but they cost very little. Perfect for kids and adults alike. Especially good for those who don't want to spend six weeks learning to use it. It's very simple to set up right out of the box. It works great with the Prime membership. If you want to watch movies or Hulu/Netflix, the iPad is superior for quality of picture. Again, you pay a hefty price for this quality. If you just want something simple and hard to break (think young kids or teens) this is definitely the best option."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,These work just fine.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great way to buy batteries!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Excellent value.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"My Dad, retired Vietnam veteran, received this as a gift and he Loves it so much. Very user friendly and great quality for the price."
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"I'm not too thrilled with the life of these batteries. They don't seem to last as long as energizer does. And in some things, they aren't even strong enough to get rid of the 'dead battery' reading."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,exactly what I wanted
2,Health & Beauty,,4,As described
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"I opened the package today and put in my son car toy, didn't work at all, I took them out and put back in again, didn't work, so I got the other brand battery and put them in, the car run just fine. I'm going to return this and will not buy amazon battery again."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This device is a nice starter tablet for kids. The Fire OS with Freetime Unlimited (free for 1 year) is an excellent environment. The warranty is great, and had we kept the device I'm sure we would have had the opportunity to use it. However, the device we received in the ""Kids Edition"" box was not registered as a ""Kids Edition"" with Amazon, thus the FreetimeUnlimited plan only lasted 30 days and the ""Kids Edition"" warranty did not apply. Amazon could not register the Fire as a ""Kids Edition"" so it was returned."
0,Electronics,0.0,0,"Cumbersome, complicated and not kid friendly..... went with Apple, suggesting you do too."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Better at the dollar store no matter what the brand
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"I was excited to expand more into the AmazonBasics brand since all previous purchases have been very well received. However, these batteries were not optimal for devices that are constantly on. We used them in gaming controllers for XBox and each set of 2 would make it about 1 day of constant family gaming/TV usage.It's very possible we received a bad batch but due to going through the entire pack in just 2 weeks compared to other brands I will have to steer clear from these in the future."
2,Electronics,,3,"This is a very basic, functional backpack that does the job that it when designed for. Unlike other, more expensive models, this one does not have the feel or look of something that you would show off to your friends. However, it holds my 16 laptop quite well and has enough pockets to contain all of my usual travel gear. The material seems to be fairly durable but it makes a crinkly sound when touched or moved. This would be a good choice for a teenager who is hard on his belongings."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This item was for my 5 year old he loves it he's able to rent books from library surf web and play games a parents dream
2,Health & Beauty,,3,i love it
0,Electronics,9.0,3,Works great to control Alexa when she understands you and has good battery life but sound lacks bass except at low volumes. gets very loud at least. Easily connects to Bluetooth.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Very easy to setup and use. Still learning to maximize the usage. The instructio is too simple and not cover much using Alexa .
0,Electronics,0.0,2,it was great for reading but the lag time for loading videos was a little bit longer than an iPad
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Would give 5 stars but THE ADDS!!!!!! Just as functional as my iPad
0,Electronics,0.0,2,I purchased this to download books for school. Screen too small and OS was not to my liking
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Amazon brand just as good as big name brands and way cheaper. Never buying another brand again!
0,Electronics,28.0,3,"My son loves it. It does have some flaws though. When he closes an app and then tries to open it again sometimes it has to download all over again. Also, even though apps are supposed to work without wifi, apps will load up fine and then we receive an error message saying we have to download the app again although the app is running perfectly in the background without wifi. Eventually all apps will disappear from the screen until we get back to wifi and restart the tablet."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,A lot of batteries for a great price
0,Electronics,0.0,3,A good choice for younger children. I bought for a 4 year old to replace a Nabi. However it doesn't have as many app choices as an Android device
2,Health & Beauty,,0,This is sth i never had with other serious brands. disappointing and returning
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Battery Ninja tested these AmazonBasics AA's in toothbrushes I did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power (mWh), but that they do not carry as much energy as others. The test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others, at least in the toothbrushes. There were no test results vs. digital cameras, photo flashes, or toys, so I'm extrapolating that these will perform like Rayovacs, not like Duracell Coppertops."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good product.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,It is just an average tablet. Bit slow but is a good option for people on budget
2,Health & Beauty,,0,WHAT A HORRENDOUS PRODUCT. I THOUGHT THAT BEING FROM AMAZON IT WOULD BE GOOD. WRONG!!!! IT'S STILL CHINESE FIRST.LASTS NOTHING (2 WEEKS IN MY COMPUTER MOUSE). DISASTROUS DISAPPOINTMENT. FIRST TIME I AM LET DOWN BY AMAZON. PITY! I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CAREFUL AND LESS GULLIBLE.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Nice tablet to work - Works perfectly, Rock solid."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,So far these have held up well against the more expensive brands.
0,Electronics,3.0,2,Much harder to work than an android. None of the wallpaper apps I downloaded from the kindle store work on the device. many of the other apps look cheap on the display. other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper $49 tablet. They make it look like an android tablet but it is not. no google play. Everything is just harder to work than on a regular android BUT for a tablet under $100 it exceeds expectations. It is more responsive than other models of fire
0,Electronics,0.0,1,"I bought 2 Amazon Kid's Fire Tablets for my two grandsons for Christmas. Included in the purchase of the A.K.F. Tablets is a one year subscription to KID's Free Time.I have called & emailed inquiring about the registration process in order for my daughter to activate & begin using the free one year subscription of KID's FREE TIME, & still no resolution.Upon trying to register tablets, credit card used to purchase is required. I do not understand why my credit card needs to be submitted in order to obtain/activate a service that is included in the already PREPAID Purchase!I have been waiting for a response since Christmas.Therefore, at this time, I would have to give a 2 star rating due to the lack of customer service available for this product. With hope of getting this issue resolved I would still recommend to a friend."

2,Health & Beauty,,1,"Lasted one month in my carbon monoxide detector. Maybe these are good for other applications, but disappointed with their performance."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Junk - after trying 10 batteries one worked!
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I already had a Fire but it didn't have enough storage space. This tablet solved that problem for me. However I'm unable to download Dropbox because it is already installed on my previous tablet and this tablet is a little different. I did however figure out that I could install One Drive and then put my photos into that program. Otherwise it is a good tablet.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Its a battery nothing much to say. I usually buy at costco but the convenience of the free delivery was the decision breaker this time.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Well packaged and seems ok for the price.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,They perform well.
0,Electronics,1.0,0,Returned it. it was a poor reader and clearly would not last..
0,Electronics,0.0,2,the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped. took back and got a replacement. this one lasted almost a month. again took it back and was told I had to deal with Amazon.Found out thru Amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it. Was upset that store associate knew nothing about the product. Had to research everything myself.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Work great and are a great price. Can't beat that! These seem to be on par with low to mid tier brand battery live so can't complain.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"Very good price for batteries, and they work flawlessly. Unfortunately, they don't come in their own Container to keep them together after opening. This means you need to have a small ziploc or something to store them in, or you are just going to have a bunch of loose batteries rolling around all over the place."
0,Electronics,2.0,3,"Really only wanted a kindle for downloading and reading books whilst traveling overseas.Seems to be OK so far, battery life seems good, relatively simple to operate, nice clear screen. My wife bought a Nook at the same time and I have to say downloading books for that seems far easier and less complicated than the Kindle Fire"
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"The tablet has a very clear and crisp screen. The device is easy to setup. There is a quite abit of preinstalled apps. The responsiveness is great, connectivity is good, but sound is not great."

Overall it's a great product for a small child"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,these batteries are just ok
2,Health & Beauty,,3,What can I say. They're AA Alkaline Batteries and they're affordable.-1 Star because the packaging was GIGANTIC compared to the size of the actual batteries.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Good price, seems to last as long as name brands I used to pay more for."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Very useful and reasonable priced merchandise also good for giving as a gift to a family member or friend.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,THEY SEEM GOOD*
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"Sorry Amazon. You guys are great at what you do by selling your products at reasonable prices and good no hassle returns and I am a very happy customer. But I purchased a box each of your AAA, AA, and D Cell batteries. I have used the AAA's for remotes with no apparent problems so far. I have not used the D Cells yet, but the AA batteries are the worst batteries I have ever used. They don't last long in my flash lights. My son had four batteries that actually blew up inside the unit. I heard a loud pop while the unit was playing after five minutes or so. I wanted to know what happened, and looked inside the unit and the green - negative containment ring/sealer had blown out and acid was all over the inside of the unit. I had to throw the rest of these batteries in the trash because I am worried about my little ones getting acid on them. Amazon Your good name should not be on those bad batteries."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Don't bother. The AA's I bought got remotes last a third as long as everready batteries.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,It's good for doing a number of basic tasks. The Amazon Underground feature is really cool. It feels like an Android but more limited.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I used to watch youtube on my phone and wife decided I needed something bigger. I seem to like it very much. I did buy a micro sd card for it.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e-reader. It's actually cheaper than most of the kindles. For that limited use, it works fine. I don't think I would want to use it as a general purpose table (too slow!). Makes a fine e-reader though. As for recommending this to a friend, I would, but would make sure they knew what I use it for."
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,This kindle is very slow at recharging. Granddaughter has a hard time waiting for it to charge.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,The is an entry level tablet for those who are looking for a budget tablet. I believe you can only access to Amazon App Store - which has fewer apps as compared to Apple Store and Google Play.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,I believe this one is more better than Duracell. Will buy again .
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Good tablet but no YouTube kids like on iPhone. Don't expect iPhone/pad quality very basic AppStore for children
2,Health & Beauty,,1,I don't know how these batteries got such great reviews. They don't last nearly as long as the brand name batteries. Don't buy these unless you want to change batteries in your kids' toys and remote controls all the time. I'm super loyal to Amazon...but not with this product.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,A lot for the price. Havnt used then yet
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Good price for a commodity item that is used around the house. Quantity is just enough so you have batteries on hand yet few enough to keep the stock fresh.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Just what I needed.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"I use them for Xbox one controllers, 2 batteries last maybe 2 weeks in my controller, but you get a good amount in the box. Might just look into rechargeable batteries. Tv remotes last longer obviously. 48 batteries for 12 was an easy sell though for me"
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"cool tablet that you can use daily, just freezes a bit, but the reset button works well."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I've love kindles for years and was looking for a bit larger reading area. That is what I got and more. I very satisfied EXCEPT it just goes blank repeatedly and for no apparent reason stay on and I am back to satisfaction.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,What a great deal!!! Haven't had an issue with the battery once!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Convenient to have several available...in the refrig.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Very nice for reading and watching videos. Strong wi fi is a must. Slippery to hold so buy a cover
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"So these are cheap batteries, and you get what you pay for. However, when used in trail cameras during cold weather the performance is poor. Cheap Rayovac batteries from Menards (48AA for about 13.00) perform much better. Will not purchase again."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,Pros: preloaded with everything your kids will need.Cons: need to buy at least 32GB microSD with it.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This fit my criteria of a low cost tablet that works well
2,Health & Beauty,,4,works
0,Electronics,0.0,2,The tablet could be great for my 4 year old daughter if it worked properly. As of right now I need to return it to see if a new one will work. There are black and grey lines across the screen most of the time. It will not go to the home screen so my daughter can play on it. I am hoping a new one will not be faulty.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"Terrible. Just changed the batteries on my wireless keyboard... yesterday. Already dead. Put another set in low powered christmas lights. Dead in about an hour. (I have another identical christmas light set, powered by Energizer batteries. Still going after many many days of running).Unfortunately bought the 48 pack. Won't make this mistake again."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Their basic AA batteries. I haven't done any detailed tests, but they seem to be working as well as any Alkaline batters we've purchased before. They are a great value as they are much cheaper per battery than any of the other name brands."
0,"Office Supplies,Electronics",0.0,2,It does its job but I would buy one which the screen is brighter. There are times that it's difficult to read because screen is not too bright
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Duran muchisimo, lo recomiendo"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Hold up really well in my son's toys, better than most so far and last a few days in my hubby's Xbox controller, but mind you the thing is hardly ever not in his hands so that's actually a pretty good span compared to others we've used."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Tap is a versatile device that serves as a music repository with on demand playback features and surprisingly high quality sound.

Overall a handy and very portable device for quality music playback and as a knowledge base access tool,"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,works great
2,Health & Beauty,,4,great
2,Health & Beauty,,1,I probably wouldn't buy these again. Each set of 4 batteries is individually shrink wrapped and very difficult to get apart. I'm sure batteries are fine if you don't mind the packaging.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,I realized after purchasing that the reason you get so many for such great price is because it takes the entire box to equate to one 12 pack of more expensive batteries. The life on these is terrible! I've used them in everything from remote controls to kid toys and they run out VERY fast. Go ahead and spend the extra money for a better quality battery.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,So simple and easy. Batteries come in a cardboard box that you use for storage.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,great batteries
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"We used in an August smart lock. We expected to get about 2-3 months of use based on the energizer batteries that came with the lock, but batteries died in 2 weeks."

0,Electronics,0.0,2,"The specs are good, feels solid, can't stand the OS. Too many ads you can't get rid of, not as customizable as I'd like. If that doesn't bother you, it's a good tablet for the price. Don't expect to run games on it, not powerful enough for that."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I have two of these for my kids. Ages 2 and 3. They are great for them to watch cartoons and they are slowly getting into the puzzles, books and games on them. Easy to setup and link to amazon account. Only gave it 4 stars because the one downfall is that these tablets are bit on the slow side when either downloading content or loading up some videos. Kids are less patient than adults you know. Overall, well worth the money."

2,Health & Beauty,,0,"Shortest battery life I have ever experienced, using a Microsoft BlueTooth mouse that I have had for years, and have never experienced a shorter time between changing batteries than with these Amazon batteries! Duracell even Energizer or Maxell are far superior given my long decades of experience. Bah Humbug to Amazon on this one."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Great value
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"So far, these hold up really well. For the price, they are simply unbeatable. They come packaged in a small, generic box. I've now tried 4 AmazonBasics products, and I haven't got a complaint about any so far. Amazon seems to not only want to make cheap products, but they also don't seem to want to get complaints and returns as well. Who has time for all of the mess So, do it right the first time, and see what happens.Thanks for another great product!*If my review was helpful in any way, please click the little YES button. If not, just laugh and move on."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This is a very good tablet. The only con is you may have to reboot it too often.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,Both of my kids love this tablet. The option to set it up for the kids is great. My 7 year old likes to play in parent mode conpaired to the kids side cause there are not a lot of options for him. Very good product would buy again
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"The batteries suck. I have them in my mouse and I have to replace them every week. My Duracell's would last a month. I feel like they are only 1/2 charged, I put new ones in my flash for my high quality camera, and the flash was really slow and dim. Pretty crappy for new batteries. I am not pleased"
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"Tablet works as expected, Apple warranty is a joke. Read the fine print, they don't cover most problems with the tablet. Learned this the hard way"
2,Health & Beauty,,0,WHAT A HORRENDOUS PRODUCT. I THOUGHT THAT BEING FROM AMAZON IT WOULD BE GOOD. WRONG!!!! IT'S STILL CHINESE FIRST.LASTS NOTHING (2 WEEKS IN MY COMPUTER MOUSE). DISASTROUS DISAPPOINTMENT. FIRST TIME I AM LET DOWN BY AMAZON. PITY! I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CAREFUL AND LESS GULLIBLE.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Price per battery is great. I checked the voltage on some of them and they were all at 1.6V. I think they will last at least as long as the brand name batteries, although I wouldn't be surprised if I were to learn they are all made by the same people and just labeled differently."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Very good product that I purchased for my godson. The only issue is the charger / charging port is having some difficulties. Will be bringing back to the store to have it looked at. My just be my 2 year old godson being a kid with it :) He loves it otherwise.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,I like how easy and fast it is to order these batteries. This is a really good price for the convenience aspect.

You're able to turn the ""side buttons"" page turning off, but can't turn the touchscreen page turning off - it sure would be nice to allow page turns only with the ""side buttons"" - I think this is a major design flaw.

0,Electronics,1.0,3,"Extra features are nice and upgrading from the Kindle Paperwhite was fairly simple. Amazon did an automatic system update which was not cool. There should have been an option to update when we wanted, not when they wanted."
0,Electronics,105.0,3,"I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you."

The OS is a bit clunky, and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets, but tough to beat the price. Speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps, but fine for books. Parental controls are helpful, but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change. Overall, OK first tablet for kids, considering the price. For adults, fine for e-books and VERY basic apps. Otherwise, best to pay up for better quality and OS efficiency."

Does more than I expected it too, tho now I'm a little disappointed that it's a little limited to Amazon-related and approved stuff. The app store for the device is more limited even tho it uses a form of Android (which means no Flash also). But I'm mostly using it for reading, so I'm happy with it and would recommend it. The 8 was the perfect size for me, the 6 screen was too small for reading comfortably and the 10 was too big as a handheld."
0,Electronics,0.0,0,I I thought the buy For my child bc the kids mode but it was very poor
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"Sorry Amazon, I love you, but these batteries are terrible. They don't last long at all. Reordered before I realized that they peter out in short order. They have failed in every application requiring batteries. Unfortunately, their made in Indonesia. Wasn't putting them in the China slot immediately but have no choice to do so. Applications referred to are, tooth brush, remote controls, motion lights, etc. Purchased, AAA AA with no difference in performance. I enjoyed the idea of being stocked up on quantity, but the quantity doesn't replace quality. Won't be ordering these batteries again. But will be shopping for a superior product.J.MAC"

2,Health & Beauty,,3,Ok
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"These batteries are only OK. They don't last as long as Duracell and when they die, it's usually instantly. One moment they seem to work fine, the very next moment they are outputting half power. I would say that about half of these batteries just simply died while being used, no warning, no gradual loss of power, simply dead. They also seem to be marginally shorter than brand-name batteries, but to be honest, I haven't measured them. Suffice it to say I've decided that I would rather spend the few extra cents per battery on brand-name batteries. It's simply not worth the savings in my opinion. (I've had similar experience with Dollar Store batteries.)"
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,Very durable and keeps my 5yr old entertained. I have to limit his use. Lots of apps/games that incorporate learning. Very age appropriate and safe. No worries on what my child is being exposed to.

2,Health & Beauty,,3,fast delivery and works as expected
0,Electronics,0.0,2,There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.

2,Health & Beauty,,1,"ehh...they run out of charge very quickly....its honestly bad for the environment. they do seem to be a bargain but a brand name might come in a smaller quantity but will last longer than these..update 1: these batteries pack's have 50 working(short term) and 50 non-working batteries...I brought multiple battery packs and all have batteries that don't work.In my estimation, i think these batteries are not worth it."

0,Electronics,7.0,3,"I was so looking forward to this that I bought it right when it popped up as available on Best Buy. This is obviously the most refined Kindle on the market as of now. The ergonomics are just perfect, as there is no other Kindle or any ebook reader for that matter that is as easy to use single handed as this one. Fits perfectly in the palm and the page turn buttons are a joy to use.The charging case can be removed while reading and it snaps back easily, you do not have to deliberately align it properly. Once the case is connected it starts charging the Kindle which prolongs its battery life.In short, if you are an avid reader and can spare $290, this is the Kindle to buy. For occasional readers it might not make sense to spend so much and the Kindle Paperwhite should do just fine."

These batteries seem to work well so far everything is going well with them. They seem to be lasting okay, we did have a couple that seemed to run down quickly, we are chalking that up to the fact that my son left the device they were in on for an extended amount of time.We will continue to use the rest of the batteries and see how the rest of them perform. I will post an update if we find we have anymore that rundown quickly."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,It's good
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"I like AmazonBasics products, so I was excited to see these batteries. To find out if they were a good value, I looked up data online. Bottom line:-- For flashlights, toys, and steady drain devices, you'll be better off buying Rayovac Alkalines here on Amazon.-- For cameras and photo flashes, Duracell Coppertops will be better.Here's why: Rayovacs cost a little bit more per battery, but they hold more energy than these AmazonBasics batteries. As a result, the final price per amount of power is about the same. You just won't have to change batteries as often.Those Rayovacs work best in steady drain devices, but not so well in cameras or flashes. For those high drain devices, Duracell Coppertops hold up better and end up being cheaper.Battery Ninja tested these AmazonBasics AA's in toothbrushes I did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power (mWh), but that they do not carry as much energy as others. The test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others, at least in the toothbrushes. There were no test results vs. digital cameras, photo flashes, or toys, so I'm extrapolating that these will perform like Rayovacs, not like Duracell Coppertops.So, the only data to compare here is the toothbrush test. For energy delivered, these AmazonBasics batteries cost about the same as Rayovac batteries but will die sooner. To say that another way, these batteries cost less, but also deliver less power.Both Rayovac and Amazon Basics are better than Energizer batteries, which appear to consistently give less power and still cost more. I guess the money goes to the Energizer Bunny.Duracell Coppertops will last longer in flashlights, toys, and toothbrushes, but cost a little bit more per unit of power (mWh). On the other hand, they hold up better in cameras and similar electronics. They're probably the best all around battery. So, if you don't like changing batteries and a willing to spend a tiny bit more, Coppertops are a good way to go.Finally, the best value battery is interesting: it is the Costco Kirkland Signature. Battery Ninja's results show that and so do the tests from Consumer Reports. You can buy those Costco batteries here on Amazon, but the price is higher than you'd get at the club. Of course, I'm not a Costco member, so it doesn't matter to me... but buying them here on Amazon is not a good value."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Lot of batteries for the price and the seem to work just as well as any name brands I have tried in the past.

I'm talking about, like, less than 10 minutes of cumulative use. The previous batteries had lasted dozens of uses probably at least 3 hours of on-time.I don't know if I got a bad batch (a BIG bad batch of 48), or if I was just tricked into having the wrong expectations.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Works better than the big name brands
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Very good batteries long lasting
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Practical table, slow, but enough to do essential things, replace a kindle reader to read by a cheapest price $29"
2,Health & Beauty,,1,They didn't last as long as say Duracell..in my opinion.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This tablet is small, compact and easy to handle. It's easy to figure out the main functions. My one complaint is that it does not support some big apps such as Dropbox or Google Drive."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Theses did not work. Wanted to make sure I had batteries for the item I was purchasing but they did not work. I had to dig some out of my junk drawer.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"For being such a small, affordable tablet, it has all the features and apps you need plus perfect size for reading books. And the best part part is it fits in almost any purse!"
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,This tablet is a great option for a child as the padded case provides excellent drop protection. The Kindleized Android is very limiting though as you cannot stream to a Chromecast and many other things you can do with a regular Android tablet (Play Store). Space is also limited (even on the large version).
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great deal!
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I gave this as a gift to a teenager. She uses it mostly for facebook and to play some games. It works fine for her. She had another smaller version of this fire that only lasted a year. I hope that this one will out last that one!!

0,Electronics,0.0,2,"Not as good as before the old kindle, just seams to work better"
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"Batteries just don't have the strength or long run time. Read all the possitive and negative comments before I bought and they are true.These batteries are good to poor in performance. They start good and quickly drain down to poor. Under heavy load they drain very quickly, will come back with a rest but drain faster each time. Dont use in equipment that have a heavy demand. Clocks would be ok. Expect 1/2 the performance of the leading brands."
2,Health & Beauty,,2,The batteries are a good price but I am not sure how charged they are. They seem to run out faster than other batteries that I have used.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,good value and packaged well. No issues with these batteries.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Too soon to tell
2,Health & Beauty,,1,Only slightly cheaper than name-brand and far less than half the capacity.
0,Electronics,4.0,3,"I believe it depends on how you want to use it. I bought this for my young kids and they are loving it. They can do basic stuff like surf the internet, watch youtube and play some games. The only complaint that I have is that sometimes it does not charge, even if you have have it connected for the whole night. You just have to restart the pad so that it can charge, but that is the only glitch."

It hasn't been working as it should and its only been a little over 2 months since she's had it. I'm going to try a hard reset on it and see if that helps.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I bought this to replace a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. I absolutely love the Kindle HD 8. It was easy to set up and very easy to find my way around.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I've never had a tablet, I-phone, Smartphone . . . Nothing but PCs. This is my first foray into these modern electronics. I must say that, while I still find it very nerve-wracking, this Amazon Fire Tablet has been pretty user-friendly for an old man like me. I'm learning something new about it every day."
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Just ok
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Awesome tablet for the price but the only con is that you can't get google play on it, you have to use the Amazon app store"
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I am very happy with my product. It's nice fancy HD is very cool. I am able to see and read my books in full format now. Thank you.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,The 48 packs are the lowest price per AA battery you will find anywhere. I have a device I use for work that needs 8 new AA batteries every working day. These batteries get me through a 12 hour day the same as the expensive batteries. I could switch to rechargeable batteries but the simplicity of just putting in new batteries and not fooling with recharging every night is worth it to me.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"I purchased these a little while back. We go through batteries pretty fast in my house and I think that these are just as good as most batteries that I am willing to pay for. The price was right and that is the biggest factor for me when it comes to choosing batteries.I would recommend these to others, but at the same time.. if you are used to duracell batteries or another popular brand, these may not be right for you. You may consider buying them and comparing them directly to duracell and determining if the cost effectiveness is better with these or the duracell.Hopefully this helps you to make an informed decision. I will continue to buy these batteries myself.I would give it a 5 star review if the batteries lasted a bit longer."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,I like the unit but battery seems to run down more quickly that my previous Fire. Also gets warm while charging.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Strong batteries!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,I have purchased Amazon batteries before and they last as long as the leading brands like Energizer or Duracell's for 3x less the cost. Most people nowadays are using rechargeable but there are a few things that still require Alkaline such as my temp signal transmitter for my digital clocks and a pair of these lasted about 9 months out in weather. Other brands died within a few months. You will not be disappointed.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Just as good as the name kind
2,Health & Beauty,,3,It's what you would expect from a good battery. Really not a lot to say. Expiration date was good. Another dependable Amazon product!
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Batteries do not last at all. Worth just getting energizer batteries instead.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,Overall good tablet for kids. My 6 and 3 year olds both enjoy it. Battery doesn't last anywhere near 7 hours though.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"Batteries were horrible. As soon as I would put a pair in my Amazon Fire stick remote, I'd get a message that batteries were low. After a day or 2 I couldn't even wake the Fire stick up because the batteries were dead. Went through the hole pack in 2 weeks."

2,Health & Beauty,,0,Horrible batteries. So far every battery we have used hasn't worked!!!
2,Health & Beauty,,0,The capacity is suspect. I seem to have gotten a lot more out of Energizer.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"These are hard to beat when it comes to price, but I have found that they do not last as long as Energizer or Duracell. They come close, I think, but definitely not as long. I use AA batteries primarily in my iMac bluetooth keyboard and mouse, for what it's worth. Still, these amazon batteries are significantly cheaper, so it all probably evens out."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,This is not what I received.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Amazon brand batteries are very poor quality. Don't last more than 3 months in a remote control (which barely uses any power). This is shameful and stupid as it diminishes confidence in the Amazon brand name.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Easy to use. Crystal clear display. Two finger operation took some getting used to. Kept all my settings from previous model. Books already purchased were still available.

2,Electronics,,3,"I needed a reasonable laptop bag and got this.On arrival I put my dell Inspiron laptop inside and the charger went in the front pocket. Inside the laptop slips in the middle then your are able to put a ipad and maybe a diary either side. As there is a slide pocket each side of the laptop.It's actually well made surprisingly and the handles on top are nice and comfortable to use/hold.The strap that goes over the should is nice, maybe could of had more padding on the shoulder strap.The reason for 4 stars is that I think the case should have more padding to protect your electrical device.It's a very nice bag and I do recommend it and for the price it is great."
0,Electronics,0.0,1,Amazon fire is a good tablet if you like e-books. It's also nice to get a six-month subscription to the Washington Post. Their claim to have 16 gigabytes of storage is misleading because it only gives you 5 and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage. Another problem is that you can't flag something as being inappropriate like you can on Samsung Galaxy tablets.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,It needs the Internet to connect to your devices and play music. Sometimes you can be cut off. The rest of the time it is easy as can be.

0,Electronics,1.0,0,I spent more time trying get it functioning than I did actually keeping this product. After a couple of days and never getting it to understand or follow my commands I returned it to BB. Also it kept trying to sell me products which I really didn‚Äôt appreciate.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Screen is very clear and battery last a long time. Very good substitute if you can afford a iPad.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great deal and good performance batteries. I've bought these in several sizes now.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Basic performance didnt last a week in an AM radio.
0,Electronics,,1,"Like DOS, you need to memorize your command and speak it out, otherwise it may not understand your command. Google Assistant is smarter. Also you cant use Spotify free account, to work around you must add a lot of free music to Amazon music into your own amazon music account before you can hear any music. Google home is more convenient this case, as you can start listening to any music channel by your free account from Spotify. If you have paid account for Spotify then not much different here. But to do searching you may be disappointed with this Tap, Google Home is just much smarter. The sound of this Tap is very good indeed, but I return it because it cant do music alarm, also it cant use Spotify for free, also its search is not smart enough, so I switched to Google Home."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great price and very fast delivery.Update: These batteries did not seem to last as long as other batteries I have used.

2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Well, these are basic, average, ordinary non-rechargeable AA batteries. You get 100 in bundles of 4 tightly wrapped in plastic, all packaged in a plain corrugated cardboard box. The price is good. The batteries are plentiful. I've read reviewer complaints here that the battery quality is inferior, that they don't work, or explode, or ooze, or don't last very long. I can't tell you about this. I don't have a battery tester and nor do I have the ambition to set up a test involving these vs. some top brands to see which work better and last longer.Don't try to charge them (duh!) and just use them. I'm not a big user of AA batteries and now that the World As I Knew It is coming to an end, there will probably be plenty of these still in my house when that end arrives."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I was very pleased with how easy it is for children to maneuver.
0,Electronics,0.0,0,I bought the kindle fire 8 for my husband and I to use. Neither one of us have been able to figure out how to use it. Every time we open it advertisements pop up. And we just try buttons to remove it. We cannot get it to rotate for our puzzles. Just too complicated to use and to navigate around. I will be returning it. We have an iPad and it's much easier.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"These batteries are the bomb. They work just as well as top brands (Energizer, Duracell) and are like half the price. They shipped super fast and there are so many that I still have some lying around from my order last year. Definitely will re-order when I run out. :)"
0,Electronics,0.0,3,was supposed to be a gift. there was a glitch in your computer system and it told me I wouldn't receive in time. ordered another one from someone else. then received it anyway. returned to store

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great Buy!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,They lasted much longer than most of the other name brand batteries.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"They seem to be holding up just as well as the top battery brands, for a fraction of the cost! Another great product from AmazonBasics-I will be hunting for their other products now!"

The fact that the graphics are worse than my phone detracts a little from the expirence, but serves to remind me that I cheaped out and bought yesterday's model. This is not a real negative, it just appeares less crisp than my phone. The increased picture size more than makes up for it in my book."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I bought this Amazon Fire HD 8 purely for personal travel use because I dont like to bring my laptop in case if I lose my laptop! This Amazon Fire is cheap enough that if I lose it during personal travel, I don't care & I will just buy another one. This is my first Amazon Fire. So far, I am happy because the screen is big enough during internet surfing that I can see a whole lot better than my 4"" cell phone. If I could ""re-do"" my purchase, I should have purchased the Amazon Fire 7. Both Fire 7 & HD 8 fit in my side pants' pocket, but HD 8 is a bit bigger & thus heavier. When I looked at both Fire 7 & HD 8 in the Best Buy store, they were not connected to wi-fi. So I purchased HD 8. And, I will keep HD 8. I dont think it would be right for me to return it to BB to exchange for 7 because I already opened the package. Overall, I am happy with Fire HD 8."

2,Health & Beauty,,1,It doesn't work with my Amazon wireless mouse
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"AmazonBasics batteries are quite good in terms of capacity -- pretty much tied for the top spot compared to the other 6 brands I've tested, but other brands have the edge in capacity per dollar. When I computed value by dividing capacity by the cost per battery of the cheapest package size, they took a respectable third place, and they have the advantage of being a trusted name compared to the value leader. In the images I have attached a graph and a table summarizing my test results for the 7 types I've tested, but if you'd like to know more about how I test ... on to the in-dept test review.I've been on a bit of a quest to test all of the top-selling aaa batteries on Amazon in a repeatable, precise way. This means the same equipment, same environmental conditions, and same slots in the equipment will be used for each test. For each test, I fully discharge 3 batteries in my Opus BT-C2000 battery analyzer at rates of 100 ma, 200 ma, and 400 ma (discharge rate affects usable capacity). I have also performed this exact same test (same equipment, same conditions) on the ACDelco, Duracell Procell, Duracell Coppertop, Energizer MAX, Maxell, and Rayovac. I have linked the other brands I've reviewed at the end of this review if you'd like to take a look at the other results for comparison purposes. For the Amazon Basics batteries, the capacity at each discharge rate was:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime Sample use case100 mA 997 mAh 10 hrs Low-power LED flashlight200 mA 914 mAh 4.5 hrs Electronic toy / medium LED flashlight400 mA 623 mAh 1.5 hrs Motorized toy / bright LED flashlightNote that these (and all other Alkalines) would achieve somewhat higher capacity (maybe 1200 mAh) in a low discharge application like a mouse, keyboard, remote control, etc because alkaline batteries have internal resistance that reduces usable capacity at high discharge rates.The capacity of these batteries is among the best I've tested -- take a look at the attached data table for comparative data. For the cost (0.31/ea in a 36 pack right now), these are a decent but beatable value -- the power supplied per dollar spent is very good, but eclipsed by other currently available options.Comparison:These batteries do well capacity-wise, but value-wise are blown away by the currently cheapest energy/dollar battery that I've tested, the ACDelco aaa's. Their capacity results were:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 1005 mAh 10 hrs200 mA 864 mAh 4.3 hrs400 mA 670 mAh 1.7 hrsAs you can see, the Amazon batteries were very comperable ... but, at the current time the AmazonBasics batteries are 0.31/ea (36 pack), while the ACDelco batteries are about 0.21/ea (48 pack) -- so the ACDelco are significantly cheaper per mAh. I did not test shelf life, so it's possible that these may hold up better sitting in a drawer. Although both the Amazon batteries and the ACDelco batteries are certainly made on contract by a third party, I do think that I trust Amazon a bit more to provide consistent batteries than ACDelco ... although I haven't had any trouble with my ACDelco batteries so far. It's also worth noting that the Amazon batteries come in clearly superior packaging - while the ACDelco batteries come in a horrible gigantic plastic blister pack, the Amazon batteries come in a closable cardboard box. If you don't go through a lot of batteries organization of your battery drawer is important to you, that could push them into the all-around winner category despite the 50 price premium.Finally, because another review specifically mentions the Rayovac AA's as being 'good' in some usage scenarios, I thought I'd share my findings for the Rayovac AAA's. In short, they're garbage - the Amazon batteries are better in EVERY case. It's possible that the Rayovac AA's are much better than the AAA's, but I think it's more likely that the version of the Rayovacs tested by the website that he got his results from is different than the most popular Rayovac on Amazon (I source all of my batteries from Amazon). I ran the Rayovac test several times because I couldn't believe how poorly they did ... here are some typical Rayovac results:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 908 mAh 9 hrs200 mA 590 mAh 2.9 hrs400 mA 443 mAh 1.1 hrsMy other battery tests/reviews:I have posted reviews for Duracell Coppertop, Duracell Procell and ACDelco aaa alkaline batteries with capacity data gathered using the exact same method and equipment. To find those reviews for comparison purposes, go to the product pages linked below and search for 'mah' under 'all reviews' (or just browse to them on my profile). If/when I do additional aaa tests/reviews in the future, I will update this list.ACDelco AAA Super Alkaline BatteriesDuracell AAA Batteries Coppertop MN2400 - 20 PackDuracell Procell AAA Batteries PC2400BKD09Energizer MAX AAA BatteriesMaxell Alkaline Battery AAA CellRayovac Alkaline AAA Batteries"

You have to walk up the the Tap to touch it - this is not as convenient and not as fun as the talking to the Echo from across the room. B. The audio quality not very good - more like a small bluetooth speaker. C. The Tap is fine around the house when it's connected to the home wi-fi, but when you are out of the house it must connect to your cell phone or other wi-fi?? That is not going to work very well."

So adding it up, I feel like I didn't spend much more than I was going to anyway - AND I get the 2 year warranty included. Not bad in my opinion. And it does a fine job with Netflix streaming so far."

0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,"This is a great tablet for kids with lot of good contents and Amazon's 2 year No-Questions asked warranty along with a free one year subscription for contents made it even better. Parental control on this is great, both us as parents and my son love this device. The only drawback I see is that the charging cable is very small length that it's hard to charge it without putting it on top of something to reach to a regular height outlet."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Amazon Basics. That's all that needs to be said:)
0,Electronics,0.0,1,When i purchased 2 if them i assumwd it would be kid friendly. Its fill with tons of bloat wear. The opening screen has about 15 -20 apps. It worse than a normal adult tablet. my kids dont use it at all because we have to unlock it for them everytime then open the kids app. Then we have to hover over them to help them ever step of the way.
0,Electronics,1.0,3,"I take it everywhere I go. It's got me back into reading again all the time. If you're a first-time kindle buyer like me, you'll enjoy this product. There are problems with installing apps like viber but still a good purchase."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Bought for 4yr old, so older kids would stop saying don't touch that. Comes with durable child case. Large enough to see and hold, but small enough to carry. Easy to use and can download favorite stuff."
0,Electronics,1.0,3,Awseome tablet for toddler. I would recommend this tablet for all age groups.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Batteries seem to work just as well as name brand batteries but at a much cheaper price.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,It's great to some extent but I was expecting more. It's unfortunate that it does not work with lots of apps. Perhaps I'm not using them correctly. I'm still learning.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great price
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Bought a lot of batteries for Christmas and the AmazonBasics Cell have been good. I haven't noticed a difference between the brand name batteries and the Amazon Basic brand. Just a lot easier to purchase and have arrive at the house and have on hand. Will buy again.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"Packaging warning. The batteries are fine but the batteries themselves come pre-wrapped in groups of four! Every time you need more than four or if you're just going to split up some sets, you have to open a new group of four, and they come wrapped in that horribly annoying cellophane like substance that is hard to remove it must be terrible for the environment."

2,Health & Beauty,,3,"These batteries are great for remotes, but I'm on the fence when it comes to a video game controller. Since I can't say how many actual hours of performance we are getting per use in the controller, I've just noticed that there are more frequent trips to the closet to replace them than usual. Although, it was over the summer and game time was higher than usual."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Everyone discusses the pros and cons of batteries. They lasted 1.2 hours less than brand A or .34 hours longer than brand B.Whatever. They're necessary. They're cheaper than some, more expensive than some. if you're buying 300 batteries a week.......Blah blah..... I have these in my flashlights. I have lots of flashlights. I don't have to go to the store. More than enough for a positive rating."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,don't last long. Replace batteries in my clock almost every 2 months.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,I love my amazon fire tablet. It's got great screen resolution and is very easy to use. It works for both adults and kids. I love the books and all the app options.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"Not a very good battery. They drain really fast. I use them in my Roku remote. I plug my headphones into the remote for wireless listening, so I'm not sure if that is a factor. But I've used several different batteries in the remote and none of them drained nearly as quick as these did. I'm talking a week and they are dead. I would not recommend them."
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,I bought this for my almost 3 year old niece and her dad told me she loves it! It has really cute educational games on it and is pretty much indestructible with the case on it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the charger has broken already.

2,Health & Beauty,,1,Dont seem to last very long
2,Health & Beauty,,1,This pillow is made of memory foam but it is rock hard. It actually made my neck pain worse. The reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is that the fabric feels nice and seems well made. This may work for some people but not me.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,not bad for price

0,Electronics,0.0,0,"We purchased this tablet for our 5 y ear old since all the other kid-friendly tablets were limited it what they had on them. Something should be changed regarding the port for the charger. The little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point, 5 months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended. I am over tablets. If you can buy it on black Friday for 25.00 bucks or less, it should be that price all year long. So now he has no tablet because I am not sending it out to have someone else's sent back to me..re-furbished. I am very disappointed."
0,"Office Supplies,Electronics",0.0,3,"I'm an optimist, and I tend to give 5 Star reviews more than anything. Which I've had people make a comment about that. However, I cannot give a 5-star review on this because it's such a simple unit, and with technology these days it should not be as expensive as it is. That being said, the display will blow your mind, it looks like real paper. I highly recommend."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Excellent for the price. I usually buy Duracell for the guys and their video game controllers -- these last just as long and saved us some .. came in a box that was great for storage and batteries were also vacuum packed by 4's inside the cardboard box. Will buy again

2,Health & Beauty,,4,they look good and a great value

0,Electronics,0.0,2,"These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case.

0,Electronics,0.0,1,"Just got this today and have been struggling with a few things. Set up itself was pretty easy right oit of the box. Had no idea I would not have access to Google Play Store. Beware, there is a much more limited selection of apps available for this device. Browsing is slow, even while in the same room with my modem. Much slower than my phone or my other tablet. Tumblr app, though able to be downloaded, malfunctions consistently. Will probably return this and get a more capable tablet, but will give it another couple of days to get used to it before doing so."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"He figured it out in no time. Be sure to combine all non-child approved apps into a folder. My only complaint is the 1 year free Amazon Freetime doesn't work without an internet connection. Not everyone has home wifi. Anyway, that's my only complaint."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Purchased this as a child's tablet and I couldn't be happier! I was buying it thinking that it would be cut-rate but ok for a small child to play with on long car rides and on rainy days. Despite the low cost and unimpressive stats I have been very surprised by the quality. The screen is perfectly adequate for games and kids shows, the parental controls/child profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers CRUSH the built in speakers on my iPad Air 2. The only drawbacks I have found so far are power related. The battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what I would consider normal use and the included charger (typical usb type) takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet. I suspect this is the charger's limitation rather than the tablet's and it may charge better with a different power supply.I wish that I had purchased two of these tablets at the price they were for sale and I would have kept the second for my own use when on the road."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,"These are an amazing product for the price. We use a battery operated sound machine for our son to sleep to, and these work just as long as the Duracell batteries we were originally using and I love that they come in 4 packs within the box, which is extremely convenient so we don't have batteries floating around once they fall out of the box."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This was an impulse buy. While getting a bigger, faster and much better tablet for my wife I decided I'd get this for myself. It did the job just fine, but after about a week I returned it. I just didn't find myself using it wnough to warrant keeping it. The price is awesome and if you don't mind it being a bit slower than other, much more expensive, tablets then I don't think you can go wrong."

2,Electronics,,2,"BETTER THAN NOTHING, But not as good as the CASE LOGIC: ELS-111 11 Chromebook/Surface 3 Sleeve. Fits the MacAir 11.6 perfect. The Amazon sleeve is simply neoprene, which snags and has so much friction, it doesn't easily slide in/out of my backpack. The Amazon quality is decent, but looks like a beer can cozy (koozie) compared to the CASE LOGIC. The CASE LOGIC IS NOT just NEOPRENE! It is highly protective, light, low density foam encased in canvas. It's more durable and slide in and out of my backpack better. Also the CASE LOGIC opens on two sides not just a slit on one side like the Amazon.(I bought both, and tried to return the AmazonBasics, yet Amazon was going to charge me 8.34 to send it back.. so i am keeping it.. Don't waste your time.. Don't make my mistake, buy the CASE LOGIC ELS-111 11 (note: last photo of Case Logic sleeve)"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Seem to work fone for a fraction of the price!

2,Health & Beauty,,2,"Battery drains quite quickly when left inside several other products I had when unused. Not sure if its cheaper than the store, but the quality is not as good as Duracell if I remember correctly.

2,Health & Beauty,,0,"This is the first Amazon product I've purchased. I thought that batteries would be a good first try since there really can't be much difference between alkaline batteries.I am a working musician teacher. I sing with a band and use a Shure Wireless Beta 58 mic. A normal set of alkaline batteries last about 7-8 hours in my mic. The first gig I used these with was about 3 1/2 hours with the mic on and by the end of the gig the light on the mic showing battery was showing that the battery was about to die. I was just lucky that it lasted long enough for the entire gig. Usually I can get two full gigs out of an alkaline battery. Just as a comparison, I usually buy the cheapest boxes of batteries at Lowe's. Those batteries are only slightly more expensive than the Amazon Basics and last twice as long in my mic.I can't say how these batteries work in other things, but I can say that for what I use them for they are a big waste of money. I would rather use batteries that cost 15-20 more and last twice as long."

2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Seem to last as long as the well known brands for a lower price, I will purchase again"
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"great if you want to read, watch a show, catch up on email, or casually browse the internet."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,It doesn't get five stars because there is an issue with the plug in for the charger. It won't plug in all the way it stays loose and comes out. Other than that it's just with my grandson want it he loves it!
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Life of battery varies with individual battery, which was disappointing. Maybe this is the difference between buying the house brand and buying the name brand--quality control."
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,Purchased this for my son. Decent tablet but not optimum
2,Health & Beauty,,4,As good as durcell batteries.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This was a replacement for an Amazon Fire tablet. This was a an up grade for my daughter who broke the screen on her old one. She absolutely loved her old one. She says the new one is even better.!!
0,Electronics,0.0,0,"Too proprietary, the apps my daughter liked I could not install on it for her so basically it was worthless for me and I returned it."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Very nice
0,Electronics,0.0,1,"Super slow, not of decent quality.I would not buy another. Memory on it is lacking for 8 gig. I will not recommend it to anyone"
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Work well enough in the small gadgets like remotes and LED flashlights.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"I had to sideload google play services to be able to download from the google play store or use google chrome as a web browser, as this tablet was designed to be exclusive to Amazon."
2,Health & Beauty,,2,we'll see how they hold up
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Bestbuy is always on top of any other brands interms of offer and quality of product as always
0,Electronics,2.0,3,"Tablet is great for kids and adult use. I purchased the tablet to use at school with students with disabilities. The tablet holds up well holds a charge throughout the week. The tablet offers games that do not require Wi-Fi or data. If you have a prime membership there are a lot of benefits when using the fire, for example free apps, free streaming movies & music, etc."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great value
0,Electronics,6.0,3,"Overall I've been very happy with my new Kindle Voyage, the screen is much sharper than my wife's paperwhite (v1) and the backlight is much more even. I've also been very happy with the page turn buttons. It makes it significantly more convenient to turn pages than using the screen and the pressure and feedback both seem about right. The only issue I have that keeps this from earning 5 stars is that the backlight on the screen has a slightly two-tone hue. It is somewhat yellowish on top and bluish on the bottom of the screen. It isn't something that really distracts from reading but it is noticeable when looking for it. Fix this so the coloring is even and it is really a perfect ereader."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"I don't have any little kids , however the big boys seem to ear these batteries just as quickly. Price was great. Satisfied our' needs."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,great price
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"Dont last long. I thought because they had the AMAZOn name they would be good, but they are no better than other generic batteries."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Good performance.
0,Electronics,0.0,0,"We purchased this tablet for our 5 y ear old since all the other kid-friendly tablets were limited it what they had on them. Something should be changed regarding the port for the charger. The little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point, 5 months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended. I am over tablets. If you can buy it on black Friday for 25.00 bucks or less, it should be that price all year long. So now he has no tablet because I am not sending it out to have someone else's sent back to me..re-furbished. I am very disappointed."
0,Electronics,0.0,1,"Hi,I ordered this for my daughter who has an extensive liking of tablets. She didnt like it because of lack of google play services and she didnt have the patience to work with it. I knew that the os is only amazon specific but despite the apps that can be downloaded, she was disappointed. I returned it.If you are an avid amazon person, the tablet works great, if you want a google tablet, this isn't for you. I would recommend these for people that want a good decent tablet that they can read and use amazon apps on."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"I love these batteries from Amazon and will continue to buy them for my controllers for gaming as they are strong enough to deal with them. I get a long life from these. As long as I do from my Duracells! I complete this review after either I or an immediate family member has tested the product thoroughly. Sometimes I have very little to say about a product if it works and it does what it is advertised. Sometimes I wax effusive, or rather poetic. Either way please be assured that we have tested the product and have been honest with you. If my review is helpful for you or makes sense, please indicate Yes below. Thank you for reading my review."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"These are your standard AA batteries that are very similar to most other AA batteries you will find at most stores. The energy output is quite similar however the price on Amazon is a lot cheaper than what you can find in the store. For that reason I really like using these batteries from Amazon Basics. They are cheap and they last an acceptable amount of time for a cheap battery.Dimensions and close-ups can be seen in the photos I have attached to the review.Included in this set are 48 batteries that are shrink wrapped in groups of 4.Pros:*Good amount of power output*Last an acceptable amount of time*Awesome priceCons:*NoneAdditional Considerations:These batteries are not rechargeable. They are one-time use. If you need a rechargeable battery you will need to look elsewhere.Overall: 5/5 stars (.5 rounds up, .5 rounds down) 5 starsIf you have any further questions regarding the product in my review please leave a comment below and I will get back to you as soon as possible."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This is by far the best reader for all lighting environments.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,"On time, product as advertised."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Happy
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Screen is good . Lack of Google play kinda hurts but you will survive. The issue of back buttons or multifunction buttons is that sometime they don't appear when you need them.. as they are part of the screen . So you have to kinda summons them which is a pain
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I've purchased a number of Kindle Fire products for family over the past several years and continue to use them. Easy to use for even my youngest Grandchildren or my 87 year old Mother-In-Law which they use as a reader and for games. An overall good value.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Easy to use even for my 3 yr old happy with how it has a lot of apps that are free same as Android to download. Good deal for the price. My son loves it.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Amazon basics are pretty good.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,I was using this for a while it was 10X faster then my kindle 5th generation yes 1gb of ram but the App Store made from Amazon is not the best so I downloaded the google play store to get the apps I mostly used I only use my kindle fire had 8 for books and reading or watching YouTube or the web I'm giving the rating 4 stars
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"I don't know, I bought them for someone else."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,A great alternative to the more expensive iPad. I prefer my paper white for reading but this is great for everything else.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I bought this for learning and entertaining purposes. My daughter is 5 & enjoys it. I compared this to other learning tablets and found for the price & protection plan this works best for us.

2,Health & Beauty,,2,They are ok batteries. I use them on my remotes and have to switch out frequently.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,I don't feel like they last as long as the name brand batteries.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"These Amazon batteries did the job although I gave 4star only because I had a few I would say a hand full of batteries that were not as strong or were pretty weak but out of a box of 48 batteries, I will definitely buy again for this priceIm pretty well satisfied.Thank you!"

0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,1,"My 5 year old dropped this from a standing position (about a foot off the ground) and it busted. I had to use the BB warranty to replace it the day after purchase for a fall that the tablet should've been able to handle that is designed for kids. I'm happy with the apps, but definitely not thrilled with the lack of protection that is designed for kids."
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Batteries seem to die quickly.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"I got tired of running back and forth to the local store to buy a small package of batteries therefore, I decided to order these since the cost for all of these batteries were approximately the same cost for 6 batteries in a pack. The price was right and the batteries are working very well. This is really a bargain."

2,Health & Beauty,,0,"I bought these several months ago. I use them for Xbox One controllers. Using Duracell batteries I get roughly 20+ hours out of 2 AA.With these Amazon ones, after about 6-7 hours I start getting low battery notices, and unlike the Duracell that I get a few warnings with, I only get one shortly before losing all power. Stick with the name brands, I tried these generic ones and regret it."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This is an awesome tablet for kids. Love the versatility. This is our 2nd since our older son loved his, we felt his younger brother needed one too. The charger is horrible though. Does not charge well at all. Returned the first kindle thinking it was the tablet. After the second had problems charging, I tried my husbands galaxy charger and it fits perfectly. Then we bought this one. Same problem. The charger that comes with the kindle simply does not fit well and give it a good charge. All 3 tablets had the same issue. I have also spoke to other parents who have experienced the same issue. So in summary, the tablet is aweosme. The charger is awful."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"For what it is, it's great. If you expect an iPad, you're not going to get it. It's a very capable tablet, and has a good variety of apps for the kids."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,We bought three including one for my 2 year old. We all love it! The only complaint is the volume. There is one speaker and so the sound is obviously lower than most other tablets with two speakers. It doesn't bother us too much but that's why we give it 4/5 stars. Overall a great tablet.
0,"Office Supplies,Electronics",0.0,3,"I have had 4 other e Readers prior to this one. This one is BY FAR my favorite. It is so easy to use, it is super light, and makes a book worm like me able to read with no effort at all!"

0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,"This has been a great replacement for my daughters Leap Pad. The parental controls are very functional and the year free download of everything has been worthwhile. I really appreciate the usage timers - they are customizable and I can set a time limit for apps, a different time limit for reading and a third time limit for videos. The case seems sturdy and should prevent damages due to drops. On top of this, it is a fully functional Kindle, and I am able to use it when she is not!"

2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Good price, well packaged. I have not used them for any real duration yet. They are shrink wrapped. However, unlike the 9 volt batteries, you can twist the package and get through the plastic wrapper."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This tablet is quite durable. The pink is vibrant and it's very easy for little fingers to hold. My granddaughter loves it.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Don't last as long as energizer but a great deal!
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"When you buy bulk batteries normally you open a box and have a bunch of batteries. With amazons frustration free packaging you open a cardboard box and find pain, hardship and loathing. I sprained a wrist trying to get the batteries out of the individual 4 pack space age metal plastic wrapping. It's terrible. It's also the first amazon product I didn't like. The first terribly packaged amazon product I've ever seen."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Ordered these batteries along with a wall mounted mirror. Upon inserting these batteries the light did not work. Thinking something was wrong with the mirror. I decided to go to Target and buy more batteries. Replacing your batteries my light now works. I would return them but the return date was past due. Thanks for your time.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"I used these in a mini led flashlight, which I use to walk my dog every night. I use the flashlight about 20-30 minutes every night and the batteries only last maybe 3 weeks."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I got this for my son to play games on soI could get my iPad back. Personally I think it's a great little tablet for kids and or for reading. Other then that it's not a high powered game playing tablet or anything to keep lots of storage on. But it works for what it's intended for andI have no problems.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Last just as long as other less expensive brands.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great price for batteries

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Cheap and last long.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Overall I like the Fire HD8 tablet, hard to beat at that price point. Sure the more expensive tablets are faster, brighter, better, but for the money and casual surfing it is just right. Good companion to Prime Membership, wouldn't be half as good without."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Second time ordering these and it probably wont be the last. Very impressed with the run time and the price is right (especially if you are a Prime member.) It's been proven to me over many years both by my own research and feedback from customers that when it comes to branded alkaline batteries the differences between Energerzier, Duracell, Radio Shack, Panasonic Ray-O-Vac and Amazon are so negligible as to make price the real deciding factor"

2,Health & Beauty,,0,"These batteries lasted barely 2 weeks in a low drain device. They actually performed worse than dollar store batteries! I can't believe there are so many positive reviews... maybe I got a bad batch. Luckily Amazon is really good about giving refunds, so this is more a warning about not wasting your time on these."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,Good compact size great display stable OS audio is good very limited apps
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"As good as any of the big name brands. Only complaint is the very difficult to remove plastic from each group of four batteries. I appreciate that Amazon is concerned with reducing package size, but wrapping them in plastic isn't working for me. Would have been much better to use a small band to keep them together since they are in a tight cardboard box, it is unlikely they will short each other out, the band probably isn't even needed."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"The Fire HD tablet is a good product. The screen has good viewing angles and the display is on point. However, the major issue I have are you have to be online to make any setting changes to the tablet.; and the advertisements that show up on the home screen is a downer. So, the rating of a 4 star is pushing for me."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This is an excellent product for kids. There are lots of games, books (including interactive ones) and cartoons. I also like you can set a time limit for how long you want your child to play or use the Fire. The only downfall is the charger cable sucks."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I thought I wanted a new Kindle, but after shopping around realized this tablet offered me a better viewing screen and many more options."
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"I ordered this online on black Friday, I live about 30 miles from nearest store and I saw the special on their website, so why not I thought. Came in yesterday. Maybe it's just because I'm not familiar with this product; I'm used to Android tablets that have you set up with your Google account. This one you set up with your Amazon account. OK, no big deal I thought, at first. Then I found it very difficult to install the free 6 month Webroot it came with. I went to Google Play as instructed, it says installed, but there is no Open button to click to continue the process, as instructed. When I contacted Amazon customer support, I was told I can't use Google Play on it and to use the app store instead. I was given a link for Webroot installation but it didn't help. I downloaded Google Chrome but can't find it on the device. No youtube, facebook, gmail apps; won't install. Again, maybe I'm just not used to the product but if I can't use Google apps on it, I won't like this. It's actually for my son and even though teens are often smarter than we adults when it comes to gadgets, LOL, I don't think he will like this either. So I'm returning this; hopefully can find an Android tablet I like (and affordable) at Best Buy."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"These were super reasonably priced. They last about as long as the dollar store ones, so if you have wall clocks or remotes that need 'em, you're good. If you have high-drain stuff, they'll burn up pretty quick. But it's still cool to have tons of AAs on hand."
0,Electronics,0.0,2,the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped. took back and got a replacement. this one lasted almost a month. again took it back and was told I had to deal with Amazon.Found out thru Amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it. Was upset that store associate knew nothing about the product. Had to research everything myself.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,They work great used all of them in 2 min on all my Kids GEOtrax trains.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"If you are looking for an easy-to-use tablet, this Fire 8 delivers! I use it for music while working out and it has many other functions that not many people know about. I like to use it as a second monitor while using my computer and I can monitor my house. Since I do not have a smart phone, this helps me out a lot."
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"This is my second time purchasing these Amazon AA batteries, the first purchase the batteries were great. I'm currently using them in LED lights for decoration and the first set I purchased would last burning 8 hours per day for a couple of weeks, however these new performance batteries noticeably dim after 3 or 4 days of burning."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,I see reviews of these batteries mostly on one end of the spectrum or the other. I love em' or I hate em'. Seems leakage is the culprit in bad reviews. I have had no problems with the AA size batteries I ordered.
0,Electronics,1.0,1,I was not overly impressed with this system. I didn't realize you have to buy Amazon prime in order to use the functions. It didn't connect easily to my phone. It wouldn't just stream music saved on my iPhone. I had to download a music app and then load my music into the app. It wouldn't work. Way too much work and added expenses in order to use. Wasn't happy with that so I returned it and purchased a jbl portable Bluetooth speaker.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,These batteries do not last very long at all.
0,"Electronics,Media",0.0,3,"Got me reading again! Love the merlot cover. This one is the smallest of all the kindle products I believe, and that's a big reason I picked. Also the lightest I believe. Battery life is forever.Two negative points are the Amazon logo in the cover, and the fact you can't do inverted text (black background white text).Those 2 points dropped it from 4 to 5 star for me.Still highly recommended."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Price is very competitive.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,I'll never run out of batteries again! insert sinister mad scientist laugh here
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good value for the price.

2,Health & Beauty,,0,"They were duds. I bought them before christmas so I could stick them in the toys and not one worked. I tried them on other items to make sure it wasn't the toys and not the batteries . Nope , it was all of the batteries. I only give one star for the reason I got them on time ....now I have a box of triple a batteries that don't work . so glad I caught that before christmas or I would have had disappointed children on christmas."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,Purchase this tablet during the Christmas sale. This tablet is a good tablet for a beginner. Easy to use and shows movies and videos very well.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,At this price point it is very good. But having being used ipad the display doesnt look sharp. Amazon app store lacks content. Overall good for my 9 yr old.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Great product. I always keep them handy to use on kids gaming controls and other miscellaneous items around the house.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"Would not buy these again. I reluctantly gave it a 2nd star because the price was good, but the batteries are pretty much 1 star. These get pretty good reviews so I was excited about them. Then the kids kept coming back WAY TOO FAST asking for batteries for their Wii remote. It didn't make sense to me until I tossed some in my blood pressure monitor. That thing runs for many months or years on a set of batteries, but not these! Only weeks with these. I don't have any kind of meter or anything like that to check them, but the proof is in the usage.......it's awful. Buy something else with a brand name."
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"Ok tablet from amazon, added Google play to device for more apps. Google how to do this."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Bought these for my children they love the camera on them. The last one they had didn't have s camera
0,Electronics,19.0,3,"I got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed. cover doesn't have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This is the third Kindle Fire in my household, but the first kid's edition. I absolutely love this thing. It's very intuitive if you've ever used another android style device. My 6 year old and 3 year old both have a their own profile, each linked with different movies/games. Setup was pretty easy with choosing preferred content based on characters/themes appropriate for their age group. Moving our Disney and other digital copies of movies was equally easy after signing in. The battery lasts about 4.5 hours before needing a charge, which is plenty for our use. The biggest complaint is that the micro USB connection isn't the best. The cord has a tendency to come loose and stop charging if the device is jostled even the tiniest amount. I've seen this problem with other Kindles as well. This is aa bunch problem if you think that you're charging it overnight only to find out that it stopped when you set it down. It also makes it very difficult to use during a charge. The amazing amount of content that you get from the Amazon library with the included year is nice as well. My 6 year old gets to try a bunch of games that I otherwise wouldn't let him try since I'd have to pay and he most likely get tired of after 5 minutes. Overall, I'd say the best kid tablet out there."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Love having a stash on batteries

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Just as great as name-brand batteries! The only difference seems to be the labels.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,does what its suppose to do but doesn't really seem to have a lot of juice in them
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Ours did not last nearly as long as energizer or Duracell in our sons toys. No real data to prove this other than we went through batteries like they were candy until I restocked with energizer.
0,Electronics,2.0,3,"Can't beat the price, it looks and feels nicer than my samsung tablet. I bought this as a gift, but I am thinking about getting one for myself."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,The only regret I have is that the price went down the week after I purchased it. It is much easier to use than a phone because of it's screen size and it's capabilities.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Being a gamer I go through batteries quite frequently.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great for the office
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Awesome, just as described!"
2,Health & Beauty,,1,I am all about Amazon Basics but I have ordered several of these for our baby toys and they don't compare at all to the Duracell ProCell that I normally order. Would love to go for a great generic brand but this just isn't it. I've been through several of these and they are consistently much faster to run out than the ProCells.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,good quality

Everyone has had poor performance. For clocks that used to have batteries last three years, this brand lasted only several weeks.

I opened up the box and took a pack of four batteries out of the case and one was leaking. I threw those away. I need batteries for one of my sons toys so opened up another pack and put the batteries in and you guessed it, there was no charge in the batteries at all. About half of the batteries in the box were dead on arrival. The other ones had a charge but did not last long. Save your self the headache and buy energizers or something else. You will pay more but they work. I tried to return this pack but I was out of the 30 day window to return so I'm out the money."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This is a great tablet. I got it on Black Friday at an amazing price. The downside: a lot of features are only available to Amazon prime and audible members with an expensive membership fee and the selection of apps is limited. But on the other hand it‚Äôs inexpensive, the Alexa app is useful, games run ok, the display and photo quality is good and it‚Äôs easy to handle. For music and books I recommend an additional memory card - I use a 128GB - which works fine."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"I didnt like it from the begining because it isnt very ergomatic. It was easy to hit the wrong button shocking your dog when it was last set to vibrate. It was veru easy to push buttuns so you cant put it in a pocket. Then a week into use while replacing a probe, I hand turned to tighten it and the prope broke with the scew end broke off level and no way to get it out. I bought a product that had a different control style (so many manufators use the same controler design) and i hsve no problems with handling this one. Another problem is that the reciever can be shook off the collar the more it is worn. We lost the reciever after a few weeks. It might be ok if your dog is a fast learner and plan to use it for just a few days."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,I was excited to see that Amazon was allowing its name to be used on batteries as I feel that Amazon is concerned about its image. Bought these batteries and placed four of them into my camera. Took 2 RAW photos and the batteries are now dead. What a disappointment.

The batteries last quite a long time and they're well worth the price you pay.We go through batteries at my house like they're going out of style, so finding a bulk amount for a reasonable price was a bit difficult. These batteries solved my problem with that. It was a great purchase, and I recommend them for you folks out there that go through batteries quickly. You'll find that to not be the case with these."

So now... I'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my iPad back... and yes, I called Amazon numerous times... they work after the fix, but the next time they go to use them they don't work again... the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app, clearing cache then doing a hard restart... then you have to wait to restart Netflix.... oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works... if it works at all"
2,Health & Beauty,,3,These are good batteries. How do I know. I installed these in my electric tooth brush 2 months ago. The brush is still buzzing my brain when I use it. No way any of the other batteries will do this. Been there done that.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Just got them so i really wont kno for a few eeeks or so how good these batteries are
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good Batteries
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Amazon product is everything you expect it to do. It has a nice sturdy feel incapabilities two rival some of the best out there. the only drawback is the proprietary operating system and method of downloading apps can seem a little bit clunky at times but with some playing around with you get used to it.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,I've never had a problem with any of Amazons stuff. I actually prefer it over namebrand because of the cost-effectiveness if it's not something that's going to show and look tacky I could care less... batteries are one of them
0,Electronics,0.0,2,Ive had the 1st kindle so it took time to get used to no keyboard but love the built in light that has auto adjusting. The homepage isnt as friendly

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Excellent batteries for the price.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I really like the Fire 8 tablet but there are some issues to be aware of. Amazon seems to subsidize the low cost of the item by requiring you to be solicited by ads and and use their apps. Every time you activate it, the screen display is a full size ad that goes away when you swipe the screen. There is no Google Play so you can only download apps chosen by Amazon at their Appstore. Otherwise, pretty cool for the money."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Batteries are awesome!! They are cost effective and last just as long as Energizer or Duracell. I have used these in both low drain (toys and small electronics) as well as high drain devices (Cameras and high powered LED flashlights). Using the Subscribe and Save makes them even more cost effective.

2,Health & Beauty,,0,"My 37 days old Amazon fire stick quit working, the system was fine it just seemed like the remote wasn't getting any juice. Tried 3 different sets of these batteries in it and it still wouldn't work-and yes, I put them in the right way. Contacted Amazon about the limited warranty on remote as it was just past 30 days purchased and couldn't return, but before sending back for warranty service and being without TV for who knows how long and just to make sure, I bought some energizer batteries. Wouldn't you know it, the remote fired right back up. Can't trust these batteries."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"We have been extremely disappointed in these batteries. Put them in our game camera and they were dead after two weeks. Should have lasted two or three months. Same thing with everything we have used these batteries for. Don't waste your money, Buy Duracell instead."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Hands down better than the top brands. Thank you Amazon.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,"I never use amazon batteries before,but I love it, It's good for the price,it last just as long as duracell batteries, and the design of the batteries is just cute"
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"AmazonBasics batteries are quite good in terms of capacity -- pretty much tied for the top spot compared to the other 6 brands I've tested, but other brands have the edge in capacity per dollar. When I computed value by dividing capacity by the cost per battery of the cheapest package size, they took a respectable third place, and they have the advantage of being a trusted name compared to the value leader. In the images I have attached a graph and a table summarizing my test results for the 7 types I've tested, but if you'd like to know more about how I test ... on to the in-dept test review.I've been on a bit of a quest to test all of the top-selling aaa batteries on Amazon in a repeatable, precise way. This means the same equipment, same environmental conditions, and same slots in the equipment will be used for each test. For each test, I fully discharge 3 batteries in my Opus BT-C2000 battery analyzer at rates of 100 ma, 200 ma, and 400 ma (discharge rate affects usable capacity). I have also performed this exact same test (same equipment, same conditions) on the ACDelco, Duracell Procell, Duracell Coppertop, Energizer MAX, Maxell, and Rayovac. I have linked the other brands I've reviewed at the end of this review if you'd like to take a look at the other results for comparison purposes. For the Amazon Basics batteries, the capacity at each discharge rate was:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime Sample use case100 mA 997 mAh 10 hrs Low-power LED flashlight200 mA 914 mAh 4.5 hrs Electronic toy / medium LED flashlight400 mA 623 mAh 1.5 hrs Motorized toy / bright LED flashlightNote that these (and all other Alkalines) would achieve somewhat higher capacity (maybe 1200 mAh) in a low discharge application like a mouse, keyboard, remote control, etc because alkaline batteries have internal resistance that reduces usable capacity at high discharge rates.The capacity of these batteries is among the best I've tested -- take a look at the attached data table for comparative data. For the cost (0.31/ea in a 36 pack right now), these are a decent but beatable value -- the power supplied per dollar spent is very good, but eclipsed by other currently available options.Comparison:These batteries do well capacity-wise, but value-wise are blown away by the currently cheapest energy/dollar battery that I've tested, the ACDelco aaa's. Their capacity results were:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 1005 mAh 10 hrs200 mA 864 mAh 4.3 hrs400 mA 670 mAh 1.7 hrsAs you can see, the Amazon batteries were very comperable ... but, at the current time the AmazonBasics batteries are 0.31/ea (36 pack), while the ACDelco batteries are about 0.21/ea (48 pack) -- so the ACDelco are significantly cheaper per mAh. I did not test shelf life, so it's possible that these may hold up better sitting in a drawer. Although both the Amazon batteries and the ACDelco batteries are certainly made on contract by a third party, I do think that I trust Amazon a bit more to provide consistent batteries than ACDelco ... although I haven't had any trouble with my ACDelco batteries so far. It's also worth noting that the Amazon batteries come in clearly superior packaging - while the ACDelco batteries come in a horrible gigantic plastic blister pack, the Amazon batteries come in a closable cardboard box. If you don't go through a lot of batteries organization of your battery drawer is important to you, that could push them into the all-around winner category despite the 50 price premium.Finally, because another review specifically mentions the Rayovac AA's as being 'good' in some usage scenarios, I thought I'd share my findings for the Rayovac AAA's. In short, they're garbage - the Amazon batteries are better in EVERY case. It's possible that the Rayovac AA's are much better than the AAA's, but I think it's more likely that the version of the Rayovacs tested by the website that he got his results from is different than the most popular Rayovac on Amazon (I source all of my batteries from Amazon). I ran the Rayovac test several times because I couldn't believe how poorly they did ... here are some typical Rayovac results:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 908 mAh 9 hrs200 mA 590 mAh 2.9 hrs400 mA 443 mAh 1.1 hrsMy other battery tests/reviews:I have posted reviews for Duracell Coppertop, Duracell Procell and ACDelco aaa alkaline batteries with capacity data gathered using the exact same method and equipment. To find those reviews for comparison purposes, go to the product pages linked below and search for 'mah' under 'all reviews' (or just browse to them on my profile). If/when I do additional aaa tests/reviews in the future, I will update this list.ACDelco AAA Super Alkaline BatteriesDuracell AAA Batteries Coppertop MN2400 - 20 PackDuracell Procell AAA Batteries PC2400BKD09Energizer MAX AAA BatteriesMaxell Alkaline Battery AAA CellRayovac Alkaline AAA Batteries"

We thought this was a good alternative (she gets $ from her grandparents, so it was her purchase) since she broke her old tablet as well. Due to her being behind 2yrs in school, we set a 2 hr limit - meaning she had to read or do other educational games for 2 hours before being able to play on it. We also set a max time so she wouldn't spend all day. It was REALLY easy to set this up & I wish it was this simple on our other kids' electronics. So, yes I had an alterior motive for moving her to an educational tablet in lieu of a camera, but some kids refuse to get outdoors. So far, a great buy!"

I have to dump then into my shirt instead of my hand they were so hot, they would burn you.Typically I can run though a wedding with energizer batters (4 AA) and only have to swap batteries once. I went through this entire pack, and had to go buy more at a store. Which the ones I bought later caused no issues and finished out the night.Very displeased and glad they did not destroy my equipment and blow up like many have had issues with.

The OS is a bit clunky, and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets, but tough to beat the price. Speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps, but fine for books. Parental controls are helpful, but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change. Overall, OK first tablet for kids, considering the price. For adults, fine for e-books and VERY basic apps. Otherwise, best to pay up for better quality and OS efficiency."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,I buy all my batteries here. Great long lasting batteries.
0,Electronics,0.0,1,"I am disappointed that this is not more toddler friendly. It is a kindle inside a kid proof case.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great price for these AAA batteries!
2,Health & Beauty,,1,Seemed to die very fast.I only purchased amazon batteries about 6 months ago and already replaced them in more than one device that should last quite a bit longer.Noticed the same for the AAA
2,Electronics,,1,The two guard stops at the bottom are WAY TOO HIGH. They dig into my wrists are are painful after only 5 minutes.Everything else about the stand is excellent for a 13 laptop. It'll only work if you use an extended keyboard.Impossible to type directly on the laptop b/c of poor design. The guards just need to be brought down and 1/2 their size and this would be perfect.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"These batteries last as long as the more expensive ones, such as Duracell or Energizer. I will definitely buy again!"

2,Health & Beauty,,0,These batteries are awful!! I usually use duracell AA in my small Christmas light strings and they last me 2.5-3 weeks with being constantly on. These have lasted about 4 days with the same use. I read other reviews which stated they were the same but it wasn't until I put them in my normal light strings that I saw the difference. Will NOT order again.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,got it because of reviews. I really can't say they are any better than any other cheaper or more expensive brand. how can you rate it or check it. when your remotes stop working you put in new batteries.simple as that.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,My grandson has thoroughly enjoyed it. Easy to use. He frequently sends us messages and pictures.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"I have encountered several AmazonBasics batteries lately which were dead on arrival. Since they are cheap, I just throw them in the trash and try some more. However this is concerning. If this occurs much more I will stop using them and purchase more traditional, reliable brands. Simply beware when you purchase these, some bad ones may be mixed in the batch."

2,Health & Beauty,,0,"I used these to replace the batteries in my digital safe. A week or two later I needed to access something from the safe, but it wouldn't open. I was sure I was entering the right code, but the safe just beeped and didn't unlock. I didn't suspect the batteries right away because they were still almost new. But eventually I plugged in a different brand and that's all it took the get the safe to work properly again. It was a big relief, and interesting to find out that AA batteries aren't all created equal."

2,Health & Beauty,,1,"The scale arrived earlier than expected, and came packaged nicely. No visible damage on the box, so I was excited to test it out. The scale came with batteries, which was very convenient. However, upon turning on the scale, I discovered that the entire lower line of the display failed to light up and change (I.E: an 8 looks like an A, 3 looks like a backwards F). Other than that, this scale would have been fantastic. One thing to note, the weighing platform is not silver itself, but rather appears to be a silver plastic."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,I bought it Xmas for my 4 yr old who always wants our iPhones to watch utube videos. It's cool looking and well made plus Alexa is helpful. It she still prefers our iPhones because the touch screen makes it a bit easier to stop her video and is more sensitive. I like it but don't live it.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"can't beat the price I bought this at from Best Buy. It has held up well inside the beefy case we bought for it, and the screen is nice and sharp. However, the unit did randomly shut off and refuses to power back up without ever coming into contact with water or any drops. I am glad that the replacement plan was very affordable."

0,Electronics,25.0,1,"The Voyage, when it worked, was great - the page turns make the reading experience seamless and the ink is crisp, making it a real upgrade from the Paperwhite. That said, it started to freeze up quickly after I got it. Hopefully this is a software issue that will be resolved soon (and the price of early adoption, sometimes), because overall, I couldn't be more pleased with the (working) Voyage."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,All good
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Several if these were dead but majority are good
0,Electronics,0.0,1,"I was initially excited to get the Kindle. I am extremely disappointed with all the ads. Even more disappointed to find out that I could pay Amazon more money to remove the ads. It's frustrating that Best Buy and more specifically Amazon, don't let the consumer know on the box or in store advertising that what you're buying is a mini advertising billboard. Why couldn't there be an upfront statement on the box or in the store stating that the ""low price"" is subsidized by all the ads on the device? Would this have changed my purchase? Absolutely!!!! I would have spent a couple bucks more and probably got a Samsung tablet."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,if you use it for certain things it's great. Can find most everything on it. Only a few things that can't be downloaded or found in the appstore
2,Health & Beauty,,4,great last long time
2,Health & Beauty,,4,work exactly as intended!
2,Health & Beauty,,1,I was really excited to find a great deal on batteries. I would have to say if you just used these batteries for remote controls. And basic stuff then this would be the battery pick hands down. I could not believe how many batteries I went through for a child's toy. These batteries don't hold there ground against brand name. I burnt through 24 amazon batteries in one month on my son's hot wheel course. Just basic use maybe an hour a day at most. Brand name has lasted 2 months.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"DON'T RECHARGE THEM LIKE SERIOUSLY DON'T!!!! they work good and last but not for to long and when two of them died i decided to recharge them and it leaked all over my battery charger. my brother took a few and i had no idea he charged a few without a problem and he didn't get his stuff ruined but i did. So if I were you, don't charge them"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Found no difference from brand name batteries. Lasts just as long, easier to manage packaging, and it's almost one third of the price."
0,Electronics,30.0,2,"I have an older Fire HD 7 and had started reading a lot more periodicals on it (okay, I admit it, comic books). So when the news about the Fire HD 8 7th generation went out, I put in a pre-order and eagerly anticipated its arrival so I could have just a slightly larger screen and better performance.The Fire HD 8 delivered on those two fronts. It's noticeably snappier than my HD 7, and the screen is larger. No arguing those points.My Fire HD 8 arrived charged to 73%, so I hooked it up to the included charger and set it to download some of the aforementioned periodicals. I checked on it two hours later and noticed that it had managed a measly 4% increase in battery charge in that time. Starting at 73%, I would have expected it to at least be in the mid to high 80s after two hours.After experimenting a bit, I found that the only way I could get a sort of decent charging speed was to turn the Fire HD off altogether and let it charge with absolutely nothing else running. I am now able to charge at a rate of about 1% every 10 to 15 minutes, an improvement over 1% per half hour, but it means having to fully turn off the Fire HD before I plug it in and then restart it when I want to use it again. The Fire HD 8 will maintain an even charge level while it is plugged in and in use, but don't expect it to replenish the battery in that state.Aside from that, the Fire HD 8 seems a decent tablet for a $100 price point. Just don't expect it to fully charge overnight if you deplete it the day before."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"The batteries are sligtly bigger and will not fit in some electronics I thought AA was the standard size Nope, I was wrong, but the good news is I now am the proud owner of 48 slightly oversized batteries that do not fit in most of my battery operated devices. Perfect! Out of 9400 reviews nobody noticed the size issue with these"
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Great for what it is. The product is solid. Got it as a gift for family.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"I've used Amazon batteries for a couple of years in everything from remotes, toys, flashlights, noise cancelling headsets, and portable games and have been very pleased. They have not let me down yet. The performance is comparable to what you get out of the leading major brands at a fraction of the price. You can save even more if you add these to your Subscribe Save items! You can't beet the price! I highly recommend them!"

2,Health & Beauty,,4,"I have quickly become a fan of Amazon Basics products. You just can't beat the price and quality. These batteries run just as long as the Duracell's I had before this purchase. I bought these based on the reviews and because the price was so good. I bought both double and triple A batteries and use them is Wireless mouse ( I have 3 Amazon Basic wireless mice), TV remotes and clocks. So far, I have noticed no poor performance and the run time is as good as anything else I have tried. I keep them on a shelf in a rough room in my basement to keep them cool and dry. The do come wrapped in 4's in the box. That keeps them organized nicely in the box, but the wrapper can be a frustration so I keep a razor knife on the same shelf which make very quick work of that. Problem solved. Overall, I am totally satisfied and as I said, I will buying more of the Amazon Basics as they become available."

The batteries leaked inside the lantern so badly that it wrecked the device altogether.

Had to buy a new lantern. Do not plan on purchasing again in future as the batteries are ineligible for a return at this point."

Especially good for those who don't want to spend six weeks learning to use it. It's very simple to set up right out of the box. It works great with the Prime membership. If you want to watch movies or Hulu/Netflix, the iPad is superior for quality of picture. Again, you pay a hefty price for this quality. If you just want something simple and hard to break (think young kids or teens) this is definitely the best option."

0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,0,"The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Great for e-reading on the go, nice and light weight, and for the price point given, definitely worth the purchase."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Works great and cheaper than at big box stores! We have lots of frameless candles, so these are great"
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Great for my kid. She takes it on all our road trip.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"The quality of Amazon AA battery is going down. Now just after a few weeks, even when it shows full power from battery power meter, the Amazon battery cannot be used in many appliances. (bluetooth keyboard, soap dispenser...)"

2,Health & Beauty,,0,"Overpriced, works about the same as raovac."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,awesome price awesome product cannot go wrong.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I got this tablet so I wouldn't have to pack up my laptop when I went to my boyfriend's when I want to do my online class. This is perfect for that
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Seems like it doesn't last as long as other battery brands.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I bought this for my mom. She enjoys checking her email and Facebook. She enjoys playing games most of all.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,hey there batteries
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Really enjoying my new tablet. I like to travel and me and my family use it to play game and watch movies. Just the right size to.
0,"Office Supplies,Electronics",0.0,3,Easy to read and maneuver. Just the right size. Well worth it.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Good but screen is not good as other tablet .. great for kids
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Nice and durable good for the kiddos but they like it so much you do have to limit their time on it
2,Health & Beauty,,4,great product for the price.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Product is great. Does a good job at interpreting voice commands. Every once in a while it would have a problem with the wifi connection.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,While it is not perfect and can be slow at times it is a good value for the price.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"It's easy to use. I can check my email, play games from AppStore, headlines news, amazon deals & offers. Very reasonable price."
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,"I've never had a tablet other than an apple. It seems to charge quite slow but I'm not sure if it's because of the tablet or the cord or some setting I'm not aware of; but it charges ridiculously slow, other than that I am very happy since it's for my son."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"No leak, nuff said"

2,Health & Beauty,,2,Totally not convinced these are as good as name brands because I have had to replace several batteries way too soon.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"She hasn't used the it yet, but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great deal on batteries..Will orderd more!! Long battery life.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Low costs batteries that work great with good extended lifetime.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,These are OK for the price. I have an LED string of dewdrop lights I bought from Amazon and these batteries will last for 3-4 days of it on 24/7 but the Costco Kirkland brand batteries will last 2 weeks being lit 24/7.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Excellent!

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great Packaging. They Are Lasting
0,Electronics,3.0,2,"The Amazon Fire HD8 (2016 model) is a great tablet for the price; however, the Fire OS offers limited abilities to the user. Personally, I wish there were ways to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a Fire TV streaming stick. Also, the inability to use the google play store is a major set back. If it weren't for those two complaint, I'd give this tablet 4 stars."
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"Very basic. If you need more than the basics, look for an Android tablet."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,These die way too fast.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I bought two of these kindles. One for my preteen granddaughter whom had no problem at all being up and running. However, My senior mother found that the touch screen was not sensitive enough for the menu to drop easily for her. As a first time user on the kindle fire my mom will take time getting used to it. However, my tech savvy granddaughter loves her already."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Got this tablet for my 3 year old daughter, and subscribed to free time to download all her favorites plus some new apps. The only issue is that some things take a while to install or load and sometimes freezes. Although I think that may be due more to my WiFi and the fact that I have a ton of devices on my network. I only wish that it was 4G or LTE instead of WiFI."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Lots of energy !!
2,Health & Beauty,,1,These might be ok for remote controls and wall clocks that don't take much power. But don't expect to use them in you digital camera. The low battery warning comes on the instant I turned on my Canon 120IS point and shoot camera with afresh pair of these batteries. Within about 2 minutes the camera dies and won't restart without another fresh set of batteries.

2,Health & Beauty,,0,"WHAT THE HECK! I have a SERIOUS issue with these batteries! I put them into my Amazon FireTV remote which kept draining batteries, and within a few minutes it quit working and gave up, thinking I had a bad remote. A few days later when I opened the case the batteries were had leaked all over the compartment.Just NOW, while typing on my keyboard, several of the batteries were sitting there next to my keyboard. I heard a hiss and felt a jet of air hit my right hand and I started coughing and choking on whatever the heck it was that came out of the battery.I'm throwing these away and will never trust this brand again."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good
0,Electronics,0.0,3,For the price I believe this is an excellent tablet .
0,"Electronics,Media",6.0,2,"Th size difference is noticeable and squarish rather then rectangular, which I prefer. The Kindle unit itself is rather nice, the auto rotate and adjust being the best part. I returned this item b/c the cover is flimsy. and I was afraid I would drop it and break the kindle."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Does the job
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great batteries. Completely exceeded my expectations.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,The batteries are good and through my research have better reviews that the Duracel Batteries.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,A lot of batteries for the good price. But they don't last too long.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,My only problem with this tablet is if you don't have internet you lose the pictures of the games you have installed and you have to guess to open them.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Not tested so I'm not sure of quality
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This is my first android tablet. It works pretty good though don't expect it to work like an iPad. The ads are extremely annoying, but that's not Best Buy's fault."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Great price and with a name like Amazon I feel these are going to be good. I bought for my daughter because I gave her something that she needed 27 (yes!) batteries for. Great value and plan on getting again if they work like I think they will. Only a 4 star rating because I don't know how long they'll last. So far so good
2,Health & Beauty,,4,These batteries are the best! I love amazon branded items!!
0,Electronics,0.0,0,The protector was not made for the Fire 7 as it was to large and had no directions that were coherent. Worse purchase from Best Buy ever.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I've had my Fire HD 8 two weeks now and I love it. This tablet is a great value.We are Prime Members and that is where this tablet SHINES. I love being able to easily access all of the Prime content as well as movies you can download and watch laterThis has a 1280/800 screen which has some really nice look to it its nice and crisp and very bright infact it is brighter then the ipad pro costing $900 base model. The build on this fire is INSANELY AWESOME running at only 7.7mm thick and the smooth glossy feel on the back it is really amazing to hold its like the futuristic tab in ur hands.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,These batteries are working great on my clocks
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"I almost reviewed these right when I got them, which was around October 6, 2015. It is now November 9th - just put 12 of these in four separate Hallmark Christmas figurines that each operate on three AAA batteries. Two stopped working within an hour and when I put new batteries in them, they worked fine - I think these just don't last and are not the best batteries. Just fyi. I am going to order some separate AAA batteries as I don't think these are great quality."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"These are the WORST batteries I have ever encountered anywhere in my 46-year life! I am appalled that Amazon put their name on them I guarantee that if these had been my first Amazon purchase, I would never have done business here again. If they had not been wrapped in packs of 4 batteries in cellophane, I would have been certain that someone else had used them all up and then returned these batteries to Amazon.None of the batteries was anywhere close to full power - they couldn't provide adequate power to anything I tried them in for any battery-powered item to work properly. Candles and flashlights were so dim I would have required more of them than I am physically capable of carrying to avoid tripping over my own feet. None of the appliance remotes would even turn their respective appliances on after these batteries were inserted. Every item I tried these batteries in also stopped working completely due to a dead battery in less than 30 minutes.Obviously, I should have returned these batteries, and I'm sure I would have done so if my mom had not had a heart attack shortly after I received them. I am just grateful she is now doing so well that neither she nor her cardiac surgeon have to rely on any battery-powered device!!!"

Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK"
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I bought this for my almost 3 year old niece and her dad told me she loves it! It has really cute educational games on it and is pretty much indestructible with the case on it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the charger has broken already.

2,Health & Beauty,,3,I've tried a lot of different batteries for my headlamps and they seem to last the longest and have the lowest price on a per battery basis. I have been using the Amazon batteries for about six months now. I guess the battery can never last as long as I think it should last so I gave it the four stars for that reason.

I thought I would need the later Ipads to get decent performance but these units handled everything I needed to do. Videos play awesome, scrolling is super smooth. Activating the tablet is also a breeze, just need an Amazon account which is free. Battery life could be better and could have included a stylus but still great tablets for beginners."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I was going to have to be face down after eye surgery recently and decided to get a tablet to be able to look at the internet and movies on something other than my phone. While there are ones which have more features (and better software), the Fire HD8 had a good price and was available. It had gotten good reviews, and it performs well, with great battery life. If you're looking for a good, basic tablet, this is a nice option."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,So far so good with these Amazon Basic batteries as i have only had them for a short period. Only time will tell how they perform or if they are prone to leakage over time.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,I only buy amazon batteries now. can't beat em
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"These don't last long. Won't be buying anymore, wish they had been better!"
2,Health & Beauty,,1,I probably wouldn't buy these again. Each set of 4 batteries is individually shrink wrapped and very difficult to get apart. I'm sure batteries are fine if you don't mind the packaging.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,It is super easy to set daily limits and goals for children on the device. Remember to set up Amazon Household which makes installing apps via site easier. Has everything a typical Android tablet has.

2,Health & Beauty,,2,"I used these batteries in one of my game cameras, but the life of theAmazon Basic battery did not last as long compared to name brand batteries.

2,Health & Beauty,,3,Seem to be comparable to other alkalines
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Good price, decent battery life"
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Haven't used them, they look fine. Probably overpaid. They arrive in a fancy cardboard box, like they're collectibles or something."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Don't look further for any other brand. You get double the amount of batteries for the same price compared to other brands. The battery life is comparable to the other name brands. Must have for every household.

2,Health & Beauty,,0,"Terrible. Just changed the batteries on my wireless keyboard... yesterday. Already dead. Put another set in low powered christmas lights. Dead in about an hour. (I have another identical christmas light set, powered by Energizer batteries. Still going after many many days of running).Unfortunately bought the 48 pack. Won't make this mistake again."
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,very durable and easy to work with. I love its functionality and my kid loves having his own tablet. good stuff
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"I have found that a large percentage of these batteries only last about half as long as Duracell. I had assumed that since Amazon doesn't own a battery factory, that these are simply a major brand that is private labeled. So I assumed they would last just as long. My TV remote came with a Sony battery, it lasted a year. I replaced it with one of these and it only lasted 5 months."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,I like it but I had a hard time figuring things out.Do I get to talk to geek squad free? Can I come down to the store and get someone to help me with my questions.Will there be a fee for that service?
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"I have two Macs, each with their own wireless mac keyboards. I used these batteries in both keyboards and each worked great for several days. My desk keyboard failed to connect last week so I attempted to replace the batteries, but they had expanded inside the keyboard and will not come out. I assumed it was a chance happening. But now my wireless keyboard at my downstairs computer just failed. The batteries have expanded inside that keyboard as well and will not come out. Amazon refunded us for the batteries but now we need to replace the two keyboards the batteries ruined."

0,"Office Supplies,Electronics",0.0,3,"Very happy with this ""basic"" ereader. Battery is great, visibility is great (even though it's not a ""paperwhite""), and form factor is comfortable. Special offers (ads) are totally non-invasive and I hardly notice anything; especially since I use the reader with wifi turned off. Sometimes I wish the power button was on the top of the device rather than bottom where I feel I'm more likely to accidentally press it, but hardly a true problem."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"Very Poor battery life... Did not even last 30 minutes in my device where I've had top notch Energizer batteries that lasted weeks if not months!!!These just do not compare to top of the line batteries. Maybe good for a TV remote, but that's about it."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"I am very disappointed in these batteries. They do not work, or if they do work it is only for a few minutes. They are a waste of money."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I've had iPad mini's before so this tablet in my opinion can't compare. However, that being said. I bought this tablet for the purpose to watch Netflix and read books on. In my opinion it handles these two task perfectly. The screen isn't as clear and crisp like other tablets but hey I didn't pay $300 for it either. I like this size and it seems fast. I'd have to say I like it a lot. On another note, I'm giving this review only 4 stars because i am absolutely annoyed at Best Buy and their shipping. This is about the 3rd time I've ordered a product and had it shipped to me and Best Buy said it would be here at a certain date and UPS screws It up every time. Don't have any issues anywhere else but always when I order from Best Buy and have it mailed to me. Anyways, the tablet is good for the price and I'd recommend it over any other lower end teblets."

0,Electronics,1.0,0,Bought this for my daughter(3) and she can't even use it because it is NOT kid friendly. It is so incredibly slow!! It freezes often and does not seem to work without wifi like it is supposed to. Also was supposed to come with a year free of Amazon free time and we have been charged for it every month !( it requires you to put a card number in before initial use. ) Keep calling Amazon and the foreign people can't seem to figure out the problem. Don't buy!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"You know those crazy cheap batteries that are so light you practically hit yourself in the face when you pick one up These aren't those.I've already purchased a couple sets of these and have been really happy with the quality/lifespan. I'd say they're DEFINTELY comparable to the more expensive name brands. I've happily recommended them to friends and family, and it's so handy always having plenty of AA batteries, especially around birthdays and holidays!"

2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Perfectly respectable battery.I have been using Duracell batteries almost exclusively since I first went to sea in the 1970s. No complaints then. Still no complaints.I bought some of these AmazonBasics batteries just to try them out. Nothing scientific--other reviewers have done that well enough.Basically I'm satisfied. When I'm at sea I'll probably stick with Duracells, but these Amazon Basics are getting the job done at home."

I plan on buying them from here from now on and keeping all my battery operated candles and lights in full use! The only reason I did not give these a 5 star rating is that I haven't used them yet but I usually by generic brands from the locals so these are probably going to be a better quality.Our household really goes through these daily for remotes, candles, string lights whatever....you name it we need batteries for it. :)"

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Bought this as a gift for my 2yr old. He loves it. Couldn't tear him away from it even when the batteries die. Wanted to get him his own data plan for when we travel longer distances so I attempted to add him to my phone plan. The only problem is the device doesn't have the option to add a sim-card, so my attempt was futile. Its really draining on my phones battery life and data to keep tethering. Soon will be looking in to another tablet/iPad option that allows for the usage of a sim-card some way or another when WiFi isn't available."
2,Health & Beauty,,1,Good price but batteries just don't last as long as name brands. My hope was to power Christmas decorations through the holidays and save a few bucks. Many of these batteries did not make it. In the future I will stick with proven brands.

2,Health & Beauty,,0,short battery life
0,Electronics,0.0,3,It is good to have this as a backup. Lags performance eventually. Not worth for the money.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This is a nice little tablet for the $60 I paid on black Friday. At the regular price I would probably have gone with something a little less restricted and without so much Amazon content. The lock screen ads aren't much of a problem, I understand Amazon sells these cheap and gets it back via ads, but the 15-20 Amazon apps are a little much. It would be easier to stomach if you could add the ones you want or remove the ones you don't. That said, I was able to install the Google Play store and this tablet does everything I need it to do. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the purchase. It's a nice new toy. One note: In the online photos the magenta looks purple. It's actually pink. If you like purple, get a black one and a purple case."

2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Bulk batteries is a must when you have three kids and two of them are twin toddlers. Battery operated toys save your sanity. I do wish more and more of these toys were rechargeable though, but until the toy companies catch up with us we can rely on Amazon Basics to provide us with what we need at an efficient cost. The batteries last a long time. Energenizer Batteries are a bit longer lasting, but these suit me just fine. Get them on subscription."

The Voyage is smaller, lighter and easier to use. Have not used it yet to read in sunlight. Wish it had some other features like - color display and sound. Waiting to see if I decide to get one until then I still am using a Nook. Very easy to download a book from public library. It is a tad expensive for what it does."

2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Amazon Batteries! They got me on the price, but how's the performance! Honestly I can't tell cause who's counting I usually by pro cells because Sometimes I'm a pro. Just kidding but really i work in entertainment so we use pro cells but I bought a box of these just to keep handy and save the day when pro cells are not available. These really aren't that bad. Pro TIP: Make sure you dispose them properly so you don't kill the earth. I'd definitely buy these again. Now that I am a father, there's all kinda of other things to put batteries in. Also do not skimp out on your earthquake kit. It sounds like whatever but honestly you need to prepare folks!"

2,Health & Beauty,,3,"I purchased these AmazonBasics batteries because I used a lot of batteries around the house and I was looking for the best value. I would say the convenience factor is there: I can stock up on these and I don't have to run to the store to pick up batteries. Compared to the Rayovac brand, which I have been using exclusively before purchasing these, I would say the AmazonBasics batteries give you just a bit less life. They do store well and perform well in most electronics that I've tested thus far."

A clear thumbs up!"

0,Electronics,1.0,3,"First, the good news. The screen is a nice brightness and the words are crisp and clear. Best of all, it is so light and tiny (esp. in the Origami case) that it is super-easy to carry around in a purse. Love that. Also it has an amazing battery life; I have never had it run out on me and I don't even have to recharge it all the time. I thought this would be perfect but I am having two problems: (1) turning pages is not as easy or pleasant as my much-older, now-defunct Kindle. If I don't touch the screen in the right place, the page won't turn, and it usually has an annoying split-second black flash on the screen. The ancient Kindle was easier. (2) About half the time, when I return to reading, the screen is ""frozen"" on the ad. It says ""swipe to open"" but no amount of swiping gets it going. I have to reach to the rear of the kindle (which means disassembling the crimp in the Origami) to press the button on the back to get it to function again. There is no rhyme nor reason to when this happens but it's about half the time. Perhaps I am doing something wrong regarding both flaws but there is no one to ask about it, Best Buy staff doesn't know."

2,Health & Beauty,,0,In Firestick remote it lasts about a week before replacement is required.

Fits perfectly in the palm and the page turn buttons are a joy to use.The charging case can be removed while reading and it snaps back easily, you do not have to deliberately align it properly. Once the case is connected it starts charging the Kindle which prolongs its battery life.In short, if you are an avid reader and can spare $290, this is the Kindle to buy. For occasional readers it might not make sense to spend so much and the Kindle Paperwhite should do just fine."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This tablet is good for kids but the battery life is not very long.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I bought this for my mom on her birthday. She loves it. It big enough and easy for her to navigate.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Great price! I finally put a big storage shelf in my garage so starting to stock up on things I use regularly. My only complaint is they are packaged in groups of four which is kind of a pain to unwrap each time you need them.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Batteries die fast
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Love the product and the price.Batteries work great. I love that I can keep extras on hand. Batteries come in either brown sturdy box or plastic box.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Have been using the older kindle fire 7"" for my kids and wanted something to gift. Kindle at this price is a very attractive product. The updates in the hardware are noticible when I compare them to my kids kindle. I gave 4 stars as I am mentally comparing this to a full featured device like the surface or the iPad Pro."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,This is so so.it is doing good.i do not know how long it can last.this is also pretty good.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This is a great tablet for someone who reads a lot, though the battery could use a little upgrading to make it last longer for voracious readers like me. I read A TON so it doesn't last very long. Other than that, I'm very pleased with the purchase and the way the salesperson (can't remember her name) handled everything for me."
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,1,"I am disappointed that this is not more toddler friendly. It is a kindle inside a kid proof case. You have to set up child locks, etc. My biggest complaint is most of the games that are available you have to be connected to the internet. I wanted something to take to church, in the car, etc."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great batteries at a fantastic price. Don't buy your batteries from Wal-Mart when you can get more than twice as many for a cheaper price on Amazon.

0,Electronics,0.0,1,"Got this for my 8yo daughter. A lot of the times it doesn't work, I have to restart it a lot, and it only has 3 apps that I added on it. It came with way too many pre-loaded apps, and the most annoying thing is that the kids profile is permanently horizontal. Not really worth the money for me, but at least she's playing her Inside Out bubble game on her own tablet instead of my IPad."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"great price, great basic battery"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,I more than recommend this purchase. I encourage it. The batteries work great. A bargain at the price and how many you get. I won't be buying batteries anywhere else again.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I like the tablet; however, there are occasions when it does not boot up when it is turned on. I probably need to take it into the store so that a determination can be made and it can be fixed."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Using my el cheapo multimeter (Fluke was at work) all batteries were well within the my device's tolerance for reading resting voltage and internal resistance. No duds here, no significant variation. They come wrapped four cells per cellophane heat shrink wrapper in a well constructed box. The wrapping on the batteries is of very high quality, much better than other name brands, let alone budget batteries I've bought. While I cannot yet comment on lifespan, I expect them to last a long time in the low drain LED lights I am using them for. For anything but AAA and CR123, I'd highly recommend buying rechargeable units and a quality charger, but for the price, I will be purchasing these AmazonBasics AAAs for as long as they are available."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"For the price a great value, will never buy another overpriced brand name battery again."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Great deal price wise but don't seem to last very long at all. So really not a good deal at all. Would not buy again.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Good price works fine.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Crazy cheap. They last about as long as name brand batteries in my Xbox controllers, TV remote, and my expansive AmazonBasics adult toy collection. What more needs to be said"
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Some of the unused batteries stored in AC room show signs of deterioration within six months of purchase. Poor battery performance
2,Health & Beauty,,3,These die so fast. I might as well have bought a 12pack at. Costco or something. Good if u want clock battery that doesn't consume much energy

2,Health & Beauty,,0,These batteries do not come close to duracel in terms of longevity.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Bought this for my mom who is 93 and her other Fire deceased. It was very easy for me to set up for her and transfer over her account information. She has really enjoyed using it and has even started using some new apps. Due to her age and my not living closer, it would be nice to be able to have a print copy of how to do things. Otherwise it is surprisingly easy for her to use."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,great price
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"I bought these because of all the ratings on Amazon but they don't last at all!! I am so disappointed. I used the in every device and every solar light and withing 2 months I have to replace them all. Now, with the the snow and cold, my yard is dark because I can't get out there. I will never buy these again."

2,Health & Beauty,,3,Good
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"As a Mom of 3 young kids, we go through batteries very quick! I've tried all types of batteries from name brand, to various store brands. Amazon compares to the top brands I've used, and in fact I would consider it a top brand. They last twice as long in my son's wireless PlayStation controllers than the Toys R Us brand we were previously using. You can't beat the price for the quality and I will only buy Amazon batteries from now on!"
2,Health & Beauty,,2,cheap battery power but they don't last well
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Not sure. have not fully tested the performance of this item.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,2,I bought it and wrapped it up immediately. So I couldn't say either way if it was good or not.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"You really cant beat the value of Kindle Fire tablets. You get decent specs for under $80. The speakers are decent, the screen isn't bad, and there are quite a few apps available. Obviously this doesn't compare with the quality of an Ipad Mini (except the sound on this may be better than Ipad mini 2 and similar to Ipad mini 4), but you are paying 1/3 of the price as well. If you are invested in the Amazon ecosystem, like my mother is, this is a great little tablet. I purchased this to replace my mother's 3 year old Kindle Fire HD7. Not that there is anything wrong with it, but the new one runs the newer apps much quicker."
0,Electronics,0.0,0,"Purchased for my Father In Law - this was the most frustrating experience. Not user friendly - not friendly at all. Stick with a name brand tablet - Apple, Samsung, etc.. Avoid this device at all costs."

The quality is better, screen is seamless with the edge, which makes it feel premium and delivers more comfortable reading experience.

2,Health & Beauty,,1,"These are nicely packaged and initially I was impressed - I didn't have to go to the store to buy batteries, they were cheaper than alternatives, and the packaging was great. I opened the first set of 4 AAA batteries and sadly found out one was already dead. We also ordered AmazonBasics AA batteries and had the same problem. 1/4 were dead. I hope this isn't a pattern for the rest of the box."

2,Health & Beauty,,1,Poor longevity.
0,Electronics,4.0,0,"Certified garbage! Lesson learned about paying attention to reviews. Fire TV box and remote was packaged like new, even included new batteries. After plugging it in it would only show Amazon logo and 'unknown boot' on screen. Cycled power several times and even tried to reset using remote buttons, no dice. I read all the negative reviews before I purchased this, I chose to take the chance so I'm angry with myself, but very disappointed with Amazon for even suggesting this is refurbished, let alone certified, as if that means something."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Perfect!
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"I have many AA battery operated things in my house. I use flameless candles that come on every night and stay on for 6 hours. I go through batteries.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"First off, I‚Äôm primaril an Apple product user that chose this unit because of its price & child centered form factor. Price - compared to an iPad was - & form factor such as weight & resilience from being dropped from reasonable heights were definite strengths. The ability to discretely control access for a 2 to 4 users was also a plus. Relative down side for me has been counter intuitive user interface as compared to Apple products."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,"I'm glad I got these. Now, I don't have to run to the store when the batteries die."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"What I found was that in our Wii controllers and Xbox controllers, the rechargeable packs would die after a few months (maybe last a year)...but then I would have spent so much on the packs that I wouldn't want to replace them, so they would stay in the charger longer and longer and when we wanted to play a game, we only got 10 minutes of play time until the rechargeable pack was dead.Then I bought batteries at Walmart (Duracell) and used those...but it was so long between changes that when we wanted to play a game 6 months later, only half the controllers worked! And I was out of batteries!Then I got an Amazon Dash button for these and now all that is gone. I put the box of batteries downstairs by the Xbox and Wii. No more dead batteries!!!! The batteries are in bundles of 4. When we get low, I'll just order another box. Best way to always keep batteries available for controllers, remotes, and such."

2,Health & Beauty,,3,"As far as value goes, I haven't seen any better for a pack of 100 batteries. We go through them in ridiculous amounts with the kids toys, like rc cars and other stuff. My son has magic tracks, and those little cars take 3 at a time and eat through batteries fast. I have noticed they don't hold a charge as long as my rayovac and duracell did, but you do get a ton for the price with these. I found them pretty comparable to the drug store off brand ones. I'll still be back for more of these when we run out, especially when Alexa has them as a deal."

1,Electronics,,3,"I waited to get this keyboard until I did a little bit of research, and I think that made all the difference. In the time it took me to do the research, Amazon had pushed out an update that fixed the Bluetooth problem the keyboard had been having. A lot of the one-star reviews are from people who bought the keyboard when this problem hadn't been solved yet.The keyboard itself has all the keys you'd expect: alphanumeric keys, up, down, left and right keys, and a few extra, like keys for the volume and a Home key that actually takes you to the carousel screen. However, there are a few curious omissions:1) No Page Up or Page Down2) No Delete key. (There's a Backspace key, but that's not the same thing.)The keys are well-spaced and it's not a problem touch typing on the keyboard. It's certainly not as spacious as a full-sized keyboard, but it's about the size of a keyboard on a smallish laptop.The one thing they could add that might make this keyboard close to perfect is a way to carry it. It's a perfect portable size, but it's not something I would want to store in a backpack. I will probably keep the box it came in for travel purposes."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I really like this tablet. I would have given 5 stars but sometimes you have to push start several times after you unlock the screen and it is a little annoying.
2,Electronics,,3,"The bag fits a 17.3 laptop quite snuggly, but it fits nonetheless. There is a considerable amount of space in each of the available sections, along several accessory pockets for those smaller items. The 2 mesh side pockets are big enough for a standard plastic water bottle, but not big enough for a nalgene water bottle.Taking it on a couple destinations so if there are any issues I find with it, I will edit my comments accordingly. As it stands now, good solid bag for the price and it does fit larger laptops."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,OK
2,Health & Beauty,,4,So far these are performing extremely well

0,Electronics,0.0,3,I've love kindles for years and was looking for a bit larger reading area. That is what I got and more. I very satisfied EXCEPT it just goes blank repeatedly and for no apparent reason stay on and I am back to satisfaction.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"Very disappointed with these batteries. I was using them in a wall clock. The clock repeatedly did not work after a new battery was put in. I figured the clock was no good, since the batteries were new. Bought a new clock, same thing happened. Decided to test the batteries prior to installation. I found that of the twenty batteries I tested, only 2 tested good. So therefore, my first clock probably wasn't bad in the first place, the batteries are faulty. I still have 12 batteries left to test, but I not hopeful that these will be any better."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,Brought for my daughter and she loves it. Wish it had more Google stuff on it
2,Health & Beauty,,4,The Amazon batteries seems to have an acceptably long life compared to much more expensive brand names. My one complaint is that they recently upsized the box the smaller package was much more convenient to store the batteries in.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,Not great for remote control car.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Great investment. I wouldn't rely on them in a high powered devices (even though I haven't tried them in anything other than computer mice and remote controllers) but I still have 90 of the batteries even after half a year of lying around. Great investment on batteries for when you need them.

2,Health & Beauty,,3,ok
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"As advertised, I have not had any problems."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I've had iPad mini's before so this tablet in my opinion can't compare. However, that being said. I bought this tablet for the purpose to watch Netflix and read books on. In my opinion it handles these two task perfectly. The screen isn't as clear and crisp like other tablets but hey I didn't pay $300 for it either. I like this size and it seems fast. I'd have to say I like it a lot. On another note, I'm giving this review only 4 stars because i am absolutely annoyed at Best Buy and their shipping. This is about the 3rd time I've ordered a product and had it shipped to me and Best Buy said it would be here at a certain date and UPS screws It up every time. Don't have any issues anywhere else but always when I order from Best Buy and have it mailed to me. Anyways, the tablet is good for the price and I'd recommend it over any other lower end teblets."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,For the price you can't get a better battery
2,Health & Beauty,,4,It was great
2,Health & Beauty,,4,great savings
0,Electronics,0.0,3,A great watch. I bought it for the heart rate feature and it is pretty accurate.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"The Amazon Fire HD8 16GB is a excellent value and performs accordingly for it's price-point. It cannot be compared with a mini-ipad at a fraction of the price. The other drawback is the , limited apps as compared to the apple store or even google store. Yes, the google store can be loaded with a little difficulty. All in all for the money, it;s a nice little tablet."
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"They're cheap but we went through these in less than half the time of the previous pack of the same, which was Duracell. I was hoping the brand wouldn't matter but it seems that in this case, it does."

0,Electronics,47.0,1,"I purchased my Kindle2 in March of 09 - and it came with this adapter and cord. It is now October 09, and the small part of the adapter for this cord has stopped working. Fortunately, I was able to plug the CORD part into my laptop's USB port, and charge the Kindle that way. While plugged into a wall socket using Amazon's adapter, it does not charge at all (no light, no charge, no nothin'). I tried using the USB/Power adapter for my iPod, but the charge light blinked intermittently, and it seemed to drain the Kindle's battery. I have only had this for 9 months. I think the adapter should last longer than that. Preferably, Amazon could/should have come up with an interface that allows the use of adapters we already have - like for our phones or iPods. It's not rocket science... but it IS marketing. I came online to purchase the replacement, but I'm not sure I want to buy the same thing.... I have both the original Kindle and the Kindle2, and I love the product, but with this adapter, I have to ask.... Why"
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Great price but not long lasting in comparison to higher priced competitors. I got about 1/5 of the life I would with Duracell.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,It was a good gift for the price and had many features and options
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great package.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Don't seem to last as long as Ray-o-vac but the price is right. My impression is subjective, I haven't done any controlled tests."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Yay! The best price and great quality
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Bunch of AA batteries. Been working fine. Seems to be a good value.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,We only use it for streaming Hulu and playing a few games but it's held its own so far.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,I buy a lot of these. I don't think that the longevity is exceptional but they are inexpensive in bulk. Worry about recycle maybe need to consider rechargeables
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Amazing so far. These AAA's are even more affordable than the brands at WalMart. Will update if they end up not being good.
0,Electronics,0.0,0,"If adding more than one child to the account, the screen will not rotate properly for the second, third, or fourth child. Geek squad could not fix this problem, seems to be a manufacturer's issue. Also, there are too many adds. I returned this product."
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"For the price, you can't really go wrong. But they don'5 last long.The only problem is that the battery life is not long at all. If you are using these in a TV Remote (or similar remotes) they will last 3-4 months.If you use these in a flashlight or power toothbrush (or similar items), they only last about a month.It seems that these don't last long in items that you need to use daily for longer periods of time. But, if you are using these for a TV/STB Remote or a holiday decoration that plays music, they will last much longer (approx 3-4 months)."
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"I like this tablet. I had a nook, the fire has more memory, bigger screen and lower price. The downside? The Amazon Fire is so ridiculously proprietary that I cannot watch any of my movies on it from my nook. This is becoming industry standard. Too bad."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"What can I say... I need them, they work, and they're less expensive."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I bought this tablet to replace another one I had that ran to slow and had barely any storage space and so far so good! I've been using it for a few hours everyday for about a week and haven't had to recharge yet! The tablet runs quickly opening browsers and apps. It has more storage than my other tablet and has an SD card port. Even though it's an 8in screen it does it feel like it because the pictures are so vivid. So far the only thing I don't like is that you can't mirror or cast it to a TV or computer screen. Other than that it seems to work great.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Much better quality than the Eveready batteries I normally purchase at a discount store. My telephone headset eats through batteries which is why I don't like to spend too much on them - the first time I used these batteries they outlasted them!
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Literally the worst battery I've ever had. I've used them in different types of products and they are DEAD WITHIN A WEEK every time. Go to the dollar tree and save yourself some money and a headache

2,Health & Beauty,,0,Worst batteries ever. They have a short life in every item I used them in. One example (but similar with all devices): I have a battery operated clock that needs the batteries changed every 3 years. I need to change these every three months. Will never purchase these again.

2,Health & Beauty,,1,"While most, modern day batteries no longer contain mercury, the Amazon basics battery line unfortunately does. Which means they're bad for the environment, and not able to be disposed of other than in appropriate hazardous waste. I'll spend the extra few dollars and buy a name brand"

2,Health & Beauty,,1,"In my opinion these did not last anywhere near as long as Duracel in things like LED candles (which is crazy) and trail cameras. Cameras were not exposed to cold temps more or less than other batteries. WE buy in bulk for the north house. Amazon Basics is great for things like sheets and beeding and towels. In my opinion the battery life, in the large package of aaa and aa size we purchased were lacking."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"These batteries literally only last 15 minutes inside of each device I put them in. When I researched the product, they told me the only way was to spend 50 on the recharger for these batteries. I personally do not buy batteries to have to spend more than what I spent on them in whole to have to buy a whole other product to recharge them. Worst amazon product I ever wasted my money on"

0,Electronics,0.0,2,"I bought the 8"" version on impulse because of an excellent offer on Black Friday. As an Amazon product, it offers Amazon apps. While you can get Google Play apps, it requires some hoops. I just discovered I can't save movies from Netflix because that only applies to the HDX version. So this product has limits. But used as a Kindle reader, or to get email via wifi, or other uses (wifi only) while traveling where you wouldn't want to take an expensive device, it is a good choice."

0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,1,"When this item is charged it works great, but it takes too long to charge. Asking my 3 year old to wait about 3 hours (no exaggerating) is a bit much.

0,Electronics,7.0,3,This speaker's forte is it's drop and charge ability. It does connect with no issues to whatever you have it paired with. The sound quality though is ok...Def not very loud and lacks the lows. But for a small portable speaker which is not expensive I would recommend it.
0,Electronics,1.0,3,the reader is very compact so it can easliy fit into a bag or pocket. The auto light feature is also a plus.it takes a little bit to get adjusted to the side tabs and presume that future versions of this device will be improved upon.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I read a huge number of books in Kindle format. This Kindle Fire is perfect for that. It's just the right balance between screen size and easy carrying. It also is great for Audible users (you will want to install a micro SD card, though). You can also use it to watch Netflix and the like, although I don't. As a tablet, it leaves a lot to be desired. If you are looking for a tablet, give this a pass. It has a lot of system lag, and Wifi reception is terrible even in areas where other devices show a strong signal!Also, you should know that you can't access any apps on the Google Play store; it's locked into Amazon. None of that bothers me because like I said, I only use it to read/listen to Kindle books, and this device works perfectly for that. Bottom line: if you just want a Kindle reading platform with some extra functionality, this will work well for you. If you're looking for the full Android tablet experience, look elsewhere."

This works great during the day and I bought a Energizer book light for 6.99 that clicks on it. The book light works just fine for night reading.

But on the other hand it‚Äôs inexpensive, the Alexa app is useful, games run ok, the display and photo quality is good and it‚Äôs easy to handle. For music and books I recommend an additional memory card - I use a 128GB - which works fine."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Only time will tell if they leak like some many Duracells or Kirkland brand.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,You can't go wrong buying 48 double A batteries for 13 bucks.

2,Health & Beauty,,0,"These batteries suck!!!!!!Stay away from them! Read bad reviews, they last only weeks."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Bought it for my wife who reads a lot of books. She loves it!!
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"It is a good tablet, but is a little slow downloading apps"
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,2,"I bought 2 of these tablets for my two youngest children. They had a lot of options to chose from as far as children apps go, but they were already familiar with the iPad since they stole mine all the time. Lol. That made it hard for them as well as myself to figure out how to use at first. Besides that, it's a good product."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,One of the best deals on batteries Ive ever gotten. I feel like they are just about as good as Duracell or Energizer but for this price you cant deny the value. Ill be buying Amazon batteries in bulk like this from now on. It's close enough to the major brands for me to switch and enjoy the value.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Work great haven't replaced any yet!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Product was as expected
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Worst battery I have ever came across. Don't use for children's toys leaks battery acid. Had in my daughters mobile and the batteries only lasted 4 days when any other battery lasts a month and when I replaced them this morning I found they leaked battery acid all over.

2,Health & Beauty,,1,Bummed. These batteries do not last long! Good for things like a clicker or something that isn't used often but we used these for Xbox one controller. With maybe 2 hours usage a day I've had to switch them out once a week.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,Great for the kids but not much space for all the apps they want.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Will buy this product at this price range again if needed.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"These batteries wore out much too quickly. I almost replaced the weather station after it went through 2 sets of batteries in about 1 month. Luckily, something else with the same kind of batteries burned out the same day and I realized that the batteries were bad, not the electronics. ."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Quality product at a reasonable cost. Travels anywhere.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,2,There's not much difference in the regular Kindle. Wait till it goes on sale.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"The tablet is great and I like the warranty that it comes with, but I don't like the charging port. The wire that comes with the device is too short and will not fully snap into the device. Which will not let you charge the device unless you place it very carefully in the right position and then don't touch it. Had to buy an after market cable with an 8mm plug length to get it to charge. We bought 2 of the tablets and they both did the same thing. On one of the tablets we bought one of the magnetic plugs so that a younger children will not have problems with a loose plug."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,I like the batteries. Seem as good as the main brands - However I do not understand why amazon has to use such wasteful packaging in a bulk box. Why pack it in sets of 4 when package is a box. It does not serve any role and just adds to landfills.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT ,,,,EXCELLENT ,,I WOULD RECCOMENT THIS TO EVERYONE,,C CHIANESE"
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Was a Gift to-for Another...but, They Loved IT also!!....driggs, 1/17/16"
2,Health & Beauty,,1,These batteries do not last long. I put some in a portable can opener and was able to open about 10 cans.
0,Electronics,5.0,3,Very pleased with the product and performance. Easy and fast to download content - such as movies and music. Took on a recent trip and now wished I had bought one sooner - fits right in back pocket of my DSLR camera bag. Only draw back was unexplained power loss - as described by other reviewers. After a day it came right back on - suggest it might be a recharging problem as after a full charge it is working fine again. For the price and content available - great buy.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I got this for my one and two year old girls and I don't have any complaints! The battery life isn't great but I don't really mind that!

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Excellent.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,they dont last long at all not worth buying
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Such a great price. From what I can tell there are just as good as any other battery.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great value and price... Will be purchasing this again and recommending to others!!!
2,Health & Beauty,,0,I find these batteries fail in a short time on items like wireless thermometers and wall clocks. On an average changing is required within a month. I would not purchase these again.
0,Electronics,0.0,1,It was too slow he didn't put any attention to it. Battery didn't last.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Low costs batteries that work great with good extended lifetime.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"I was skeptical at first, but these AmazonBasics batteries are pretty competitive to Duracell and Energizer alkaline batteries."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"I read a lot of reviews and convinced myself the AmazonBasics AA alkaline batteries were going to be a good buy. Nope. I put a pair in my TV remote, and within a month the TV was telling me to replace the batteries because of low power. I decided to check some new ones right out of the wrapper with my battery tester. 8 brand new batteries tested - all 8 in the red on the battery tester...not totally dead, but just inside the red. Next trip to Home Depot, I picked up the big pack of Energizer AA batteries and did the same test on them. 8 for 8 all in the green on my battery tester.Oh well, not worth crying about 13 worth of weak batteries. I am sure others have had great luck with the same AmazonBasics AA batteries. I just wanted to add my experience so others can make an informed decision. Good luck!"
0,Electronics,2.0,3,"Great buy after owning the original kindle Fire, it's very versatile and shows the progress made from the original. You can't lose and pair it with Amazon Prime."
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,2,"Thought this would be perfect for my two children. The case, warranty and pass to download unlimited apps seemed great. However, the pad is sometimes unresponsive and inaccurate-which can be frustrating for children. The case is a little too bulky. And it can be confusing for children who want to push an icon to play but it instead downloads. There is a definite learning curve that they will overcome in time but it could be more user friendly for younger users."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I have purchased other tablets such as a kurio for kids and this is by far the best. It has all the apps you need as an adult, great for both adults and kids to read books and great visuals. Only bad thing like my old Kindle fire, the micro-usb portion gets loose."
0,Electronics,0.0,0,"I didon't care for this tablet, downloading apps outside of Amazon was really confusing."
0,Electronics,2.0,3,"I believe it depends on how you want to use it. I bought this for my young kids and they are loving it. They can do basic stuff like surf the internet, watch youtube and play some games. The only complaint that I have is that sometimes it does not charge, even if you have have it connected for the whole night. You just have to restart the pad so that it can charge, but that is the only glitch."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Decent longevity in electronics we use daily. In remotes they're fabulous, less so in more demanding electronics like games, cameras, and the half dozen Thomas trains my son loves. For the price in comparison to Duracell or Energizer you can't go wrong."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Worst battery I've ever used. Lasts 1/3 as long as eveready!!!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,These are great batteries at a great cost. I will continue to purchase these. I replaced batteries in my outdoor solar lights and I have many and these work great. Highly recommend.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,A Great Deal On Great Batteries.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This product was purchased for my son to use with another product that required this particular tablet. I think compared to other brands we have or have had this one is pretty good, easy to operate, and I like that the parent has to approve of the settings and games/activity for the child to use. I would however like to see this product allow google accounts to hook up with it so that way you can get stuff from google play on it that amazon store doesn't have!"
2,Health & Beauty,,1,The batteries came vacuum-sealed in packs of 4 in this really heavy/annoying plastic.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,These are so wasteful!! Rechargeable batteries are so much better!! The Amazon rechargeable ones are awesome!! And you can use and reuse and recharge and reuse them again and again and again and AGAIN!!
0,Electronics,0.0,2,I bought it and wrapped it up immediately. So I couldn't say either way if it was good or not.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Very happy with the Tap. We have the Echo and would have to unplug it and plug it in to use it on the deck. With the Tap we just take it off the charging stand and go. No more bothering with Bluetooth speakers and using our phone when we can just play music ever from the Internet with TAP.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"I really wanted to give this device a chance but I did end up returning it. It's a HUGE upgrade though over the cheaper 7"" version. Honestly I don't think anyone should purchase that. If your budget can handle getting this version and you are heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem (i.e. Prime member) this will make a great tablet. I think it is intended more for kids though than adults. Having iPads in the house we tried this with our toddler as a cheaper tablet for her but the interface and quirks of the Amazon OS just were not worth the hassle. Will end up seeking out a used iPad Mini 2 instead of this."
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Batteries seem to die quickly.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,They do not last at all! I never leave negative reviews as I am generally satisfied. But logged back in just to do it! They are awful!!!

0,"Office Supplies,Electronics",17.0,3,"I purchased this Kindle for my wife because her Kindle Fire gives off too much glare to use in sunny conditions. Besides being able to use it while riding in the car during daytime, the biggest advantage she found is that it is significantly lighter than the Fire. Since she reads for hours on end that is a big plus. The main drawback is that the graphics aren't as clear with this reader. All in all, it was money well spent."

0,Electronics,6.0,3,"Hands down the best ereader available. I researched several devices and it came down to the Paperwhite and the Voyage. There is a pretty hefty price premium for the Voyage. Most people will probably be very satisfied with the Paperwhite. I typically need reading glasses to read regular size print. On an eReader the font can be adjusted to make it large enough so I don't need to use the glasses. That means less text on each page and many more page turns. The physical ""buttons"" hep make the page turns easier and extra light brightness helps to add contrast to the text. These were enough to sell me on the Voyage. It was the right decision and I love the device."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I have really enjoyed it so far. While not perfect by any means it is certainly worth the price.

I am visiting, and just opened the brand new package, and inserted 4 of them to run his blood pressure cuff. The machine worked, but the battery indicator showed low, I switched the batteries with other brand new amazon batteries - same reading. Then I switched with another set of name brand batteries, and the battery indicator showed high/full. If I was home, I would have used my battery meter. No 10 year shelf life - not even a 10 month shelf life. Amazon, I am usually one of your biggest fans, but not this time."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,These batteries are as good or better than any brand of alkaline battery on the market today.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Compared to dollar store like batteries these seem to be better but not like twice as good. For the price and quantity it's worth the purchase.Use them in tv remotes to chess computers to kids toys and can't complain. Amazing how many items require AA batteries today.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Packaged very well,just what I wanted."
0,Electronics,1.0,2,It is the top of the line e reader by amazon which is also the leader in e readers. The voyage is an excellent device and very versatile to carry on your trips.

2,Health & Beauty,,0,"These batteries lasted barely 2 weeks in a low drain device. They actually performed worse than dollar store batteries!

0,Electronics,1.0,3,"After dropping my Kindle with a keyboard (not techie enough to know which generation it was) I did plenty of research before getting my next Kindle.I wanted a dedicated ebook as I don't want distractions when I read. Let's make this simple:I have read in sunlight and there have been no problems with glare.The automatic light makes it great for night reading.It took a while to get used to the buttons, but after my last Kindle, this was a feature I really wanted. I like them.I have read only three books on the Kindle so far and I still haven't mastered the touch of getting it to do what I want when I want. I am fighting it to highlight, and tap like a madman to change between page number and time left in the chapter/book (which are features I love).Excellent reader. I would purchase again, but I can't say with any honesty that the extra $100 was worth it over the Paperwhite, but I have no experience with that model either.

0,Electronics,0.0,2,"I ordered this online on black Friday, I live about 30 miles from nearest store and I saw the special on their website, so why not I thought. Came in yesterday. Maybe it's just because I'm not familiar with this product; I'm used to Android tablets that have you set up with your Google account. This one you set up with your Amazon account. OK, no big deal I thought, at first. Then I found it very difficult to install the free 6 month Webroot it came with. I went to Google Play as instructed, it says installed, but there is no Open button to click to continue the process, as instructed. When I contacted Amazon customer support, I was told I can't use Google Play on it and to use the app store instead. I was given a link for Webroot installation but it didn't help. I downloaded Google Chrome but can't find it on the device. No youtube, facebook, gmail apps; won't install. Again, maybe I'm just not used to the product but if I can't use Google apps on it, I won't like this. It's actually for my son and even though teens are often smarter than we adults when it comes to gadgets, LOL, I don't think he will like this either. So I'm returning this; hopefully can find an Android tablet I like (and affordable) at Best Buy."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,hard to find a better deal then this
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"I've used 10 so far, 4 in a wire less mouse and had a short life , comparing them with Maxwell batteries I used before."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,great value
2,Health & Beauty,,1,Batteries didn't last a year. Last several batteries were dead.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Great performance, great price. Thank you Amazon"
2,Health & Beauty,,3,These are AA batteries and they work. They do seem to die a bit faster in my Speedlight then duracells but maybe I just use it more since I have the 48 pack.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This was bought as a replacement to a shattered screen kindle. We are always happy with our kindle but can i just tell you how easy it was to set up the replacement!?!? Literally no strain on the brain, follow screen instructions and EVERYTHING from old kindle transferred over flawlessly! Awesome!"

2,Health & Beauty,,3,to early to tell but like the price
2,Health & Beauty,,4,good
0,Electronics,0.0,2,Speakers stuck on this thing . I bought it to give to my grandma but she found it too difficult.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,VERY price-effective.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,I ordered AA
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Wish I had opened the package all the way as soon as I received it because several of the batteries had leaked and caused corrosion on several more. Learned one this time.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"So far these batteries are perfect. I put a fresh set in my electric toothbrush and thought my teeth were going to buzz out of their sockets. Not really, but they do seem to have more 'juice' than the national brands, if that is possible."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"They work just fine. No complaints, go batteries!"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,As good or better than any major brand out there.The price is a fraction of what the major brands are.Time will tell what the durability is.This proves what a rip off battery prices are from the major brand manufacturers.
0,Electronics,1.0,3,This tablet it will do the job but mostle for games videos YouTube etc is really slow so if you are looking for somthing fas skip this tablet
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"When I ran out of AA batteries, I of course came to Amazon to purchase more. As I am on a tight budget, I decided to go with the AmazonBasics brand. When they arrived, I immediately replaced the batteries in my Xbox controller. I noticed that the batteries did not last as long as the more popular name brands. (i.e. Duracell, Energizer, etc.) This is the only reason I have rated the product with 4 stars instead of 5. Everything else about these batteries is great. I am getting low already and will probably order them again."
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"I purchased a box of 48 AA batteries and the first 2 that I tried to use were dead the other 2 in the blister 4 pack worked fine, but a 50 failure rate is unacceptable. I will update how the rest of the box works as I try to use them. I will purchase a name brand next time."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Awesome.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"I hate running out of batteries so I bought this giant pack. It's a good value and the batteries seem to have plenty of juice for normal, non-hardcore activities (TV remotes, flashlights, that kind of thing). I haven't tried them in any high-power devices like digital cameras or remote control cars not sure if they would be the best choice in that case.Edit: they do not last as long as Duracells or Energizers"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"I purchased this product for my own use, and Ive found it to be a great product. Size, fit, quality and the whole mess is top notch. I have to admit I was a little hesitant at first, given the price, but after opening the box I immediately realized I had made a good purchase. I can imagine using this item for a long time, and should I need another Ill likely buy one just like this."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Very kid friendly especially with 2 younger siblings. Bright color is fun and easy to find

The actual tablet is very easy for my daughter to use, and am very happy for the parental options. Also think included apps are helpful. Really like the additional user options, so anyone can have their separate preferences set up. The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because since purchasing the charging area on the tablet doesn't hold the cord at all and is always constantly falling out which is extremely frustrating!"
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"Batteries are great, price isn't the best. I've seen similar packs of generic batteries for cheaper. Wegmans comes to mind.."

0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,1,"This is a good tablet for children and adults too. However there is an issue with the port and charger cable. We did not even have this tablet 3 weeks before it would barley charge.

Its really frustrating."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,very good items!!
0,Electronics,0.0,2,Battery life is very long and the sound is surprisingly good. Alexa is not as 'smart' as the marketing would like you to think. I get a lot of 'I don't know the answer to that'
2,Health & Beauty,,1,Very nice looking in picture and from a distance but the clock itself is cheaply made....The actual clock mechanism stopped working twice and doesn't work at all now.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"WTH!! Went through these extremely fast - it seems there were many DUDS filtered in with a few good batteries!! by the time I realized this, it was over thirty days, so live and learn."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good price
0,Electronics,11.0,3,"Got this for my 9 year old after her ipad crashed and burned. She does not like androids at all but I couldn't afford a expensive tablet for her. So we took a chance with this one. She is pleased and I'm pleased it seems so sturdy , not cheap quality at all. Going to get our youngest child one now. Very pleased."
2,Electronics,,3,"Every other laptop cooler I have purchased has a USB plug to run a fan. Got tired of the fans making noise, the USB or cooler plug not working eventually etc.So gave this one a shot and it does what it says plus. Keeps my 15.6 Mac book pro cool and my legs are not heating up any more when sitting on the couch. Also the bottom does not feel nearly as hot as it used to. So why only 4 stars. The two tabs to keep your laptop from sliding off are not adjustable so when you are typing your arms want to rest on those tabs. Really uncomfortable. So in the pictures you can see a slight modification I made to alleviate this problem. I now rest the laptop on the pads so when typing my arms are resting on the key board portion as if the tabs were not there. Much more comfortable. I used strips of thick felt with sticky bottoms. Certainly not a technical fix but does the job. All they had to do was include a metal piece retrofit on the bottom portion that would allow you to raise your computer to a level so the tabs would not interfere. Simple but maybe on the next model. Check out the two photos."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"With a price tag of 59.99, this is one of the low-end tablets with a lot of features, but is certainly worth its price tag. But it definitely lacks the features and HD display of its high end variant Fire HD."

2,Health & Beauty,,3,Great price for good performance.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Super cheap, super good."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,OK

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Worked as expected great value
2,Health & Beauty,,3,I see reviews of these batteries mostly on one end of the spectrum or the other. I love em' or I hate em'. Seems leakage is the culprit in bad reviews. I have had no problems with the AA size batteries I ordered.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I was looking to upgrade from my old Kindle reader and stumbled on the Fire HD which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. Fairly easy to use. I really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. I wish it supported all google play apps and not just Amazon apps but I can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose. But...when I want to read in the middle of the night, getting to the web can be distracting."

Set alarms, timers, get your local weather and who won the game last night. It can do too many things for me to list. It's great for everything however not great for music. I do listen to my local radio station on it - but compared to its' BIGGER brother Echo the sound is not that good."

It is now November 9th - just put 12 of these in four separate Hallmark Christmas figurines that each operate on three AAA batteries. Two stopped working within an hour and when I put new batteries in them, they worked fine - I think these just don't last and are not the best batteries. Just fyi. I am going to order some separate AAA batteries as I don't think these are great quality."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"The batteries are fine, but the fact it defaults to a subscription sale is rally wrong, IMHO."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,GREAT PRICE.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,These have been the worse batteries. I've bought these before and didn't have a problem but this batch doesn't even last a month.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"I looked at the math about the capacity and strength and longevity of different batteries and a lot of them are similar, including these, and these make the most sense price wise.I have tried HUNDREDS of rechargeable batteries and they get recharged a couple of times and then disappear. At a certain point they are just a waste of money."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Good value.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This is a great tablet for kids with lot of good contents and Amazon's 2 year No-Questions asked warranty along with a free one year subscription for contents made it even better. Parental control on this is great, both us as parents and my son love this device. The only drawback I see is that the charging cable is very small length that it's hard to charge it without putting it on top of something to reach to a regular height outlet."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Quality batteries for a decent price.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great value
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"If you're looking for cheap but durable batteries look no further. I personally like amazon products. I know I can count on them as much as a named brand, but for a 1/4 of the price. I got these on Prime day for a great price and the last a OK amount of time. I used them on my xbox controller, but i think it soaked up more power than I thought so the batteries died with in a month or so. Its not like I keep track, but noticing the controller shutting off was what lead me on to the life of the batteries. I have enough to last me a year or so. Again, good buy. If you're looking to save money from the expensive name brands, go with a Amazon brand product its becoming more common and competitive as a name brand product."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,amazon sucks these batteries drain like the water in my toilet
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"So far, so good! Works and last as well as the most expensive named brand."

2,Health & Beauty,,1,These batteries do not last long at all as compared to Energizer. After 4 days of use they were no good anymore.

0,Electronics,0.0,1,Amazon fire is a good tablet if you like e-books. It's also nice to get a six-month subscription to the Washington Post. Their claim to have 16 gigabytes of storage is misleading because it only gives you 5 and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage. Another problem is that you can't flag something as being inappropriate like you can on Samsung Galaxy tablets.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,My daughter got this tablet for Christmas and is very happy with it. The parental controls are awesome and make me feel safe as a parent. Only complaint is that is doesn't come with set up instructions.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Got this for the family and we all love it. Great gift
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Nice size screen easy and light weight to take to class
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"First, the bad. I hate the advertisements and the fact that you can't access the vast library of Android apps via Google Play. Nevertheless, you can do most of the things on the Internet that you need to while still have access to Amazon Fire-friendly apps that will keep you informed and entertained. The good news is that the HD8 has an expansion slot for a microSD card and increasing storage space is where the Fire HD8 dances all over the iPad. Add in a 128GB microSD card and you'll have tons of room for audiobooks, ebooks, music files, photos, and videos. The HD8 also has Amazon Alexa in case you're looking for automated help to shop or move around from interest online or on your Kindle Fire.It's a good buy - especially if you buy one when they are on sale!"
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Overall, not a bad tablet. The price is good and the features are pretty nice. It was bought as a gift and I can say that she loved it."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,High quality batteries
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Awesome Amazon product! Using them for various electronics and my son's wireless headphones! Thanks Amazon!
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This is a great starter tablet. Purchased for my 6 year old, it has been easy to use. Only giving get four stars because there should be a better way to control purchases. My son figured out quickly how to purchase apps. Finally figured out how to put a pin on app purchases."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Convenient and easy for my 10 year old to use to do homework on.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,big pack of batteries...work well :)
2,Health & Beauty,,4,same..they fulfill a need
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Came as described. I would buy again
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Great for my kid. She takes it on all our road trip.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Very easy to use and love the graphics of the screen.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,These die a lot quicker than typical energizer and duracell batteries
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. Used it everyday. Very good product and screen size is perfect for him.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. The graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. Also it is a Amazon tablet with no Google play store but you can load Google play on to it. There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn't hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don't know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn't sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets. I hope this helps thanks.
0,Electronics,0.0,1,"I bought this Kindle for my 7 year old grand-daughter. I bought a warranty for it. I bought it in August, I have already had to replace it. The charger connection got loose and was not charging. Well, it has happened again. I will need to exchange it again. The problem is that I have to buy the warranty each time. I was going to buy one for her brothers and sister, but I am now rethinking that."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great price
2,Health & Beauty,,4,I usually only buy Duracell batteries that I purchase on sale through Groupon. I received a bad batch and it always takes so long to get them that I decided to give the Amazon batteries a try. I'll never buy another battery anywhere else. Thank you Amazon for providing another quality product that worked as well as the most expensive brands out there at a reduced price. Shipping was prompt and on time.
0,Electronics,1.0,3,"Grandson has loved this since he opened it for his Birthday He was able to use it,figure it out, right away The protective case actually makes it easier for him to handle. Simple to set up for his home internet and parents were able to view and set up controls of their choice."

0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,We love this tablet for our 2 year old. She can operate it on her own and it has a great variety of educational and learning games for her. We love that it has skype capabilities but the volume for skype is very quiet. Overall great tablet for a first tablet for kids!!
2,Health & Beauty,,1,These batteries don't seem to last as long as other brands.
0,Electronics,1.0,1,"If you need a basic tablet then the fire works. It falls apart when compared to the iPad mini from a usability, functionality and available apps standpoint."
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,Pros: a lot of things for kids to do from apps to watching movie and playing games. Cons: like most androids it tends to freeze.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,do not last as long as energizer...very comparable to toys r us batteries
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Cheap and functional. Can't ask for much more.
0,Electronics,1.0,3,"I bought it for my husband for a gift but I use it as much as he does. Perfect size, good sound quality overall great product."
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Goog
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"So, I saw all the glowing reviews and was startled by the low price for 48 of this alkaline batteries. Yeah, well, NOW I am startled by how long they last. Uh-oh, make that DON'T last. I don't take but 20 to 30 shots from my little Finepix camera before the lens starts closing when I try to shoot. Compare that to...well, I'm not gonna lie. I never counted, but I took TONS of shots using Duracell alkaline bats. Conservative estimate At least 300 shots for each set of two. Einstein not needed to do the math on that. I just looked and see that they are made in Indonesia, which may or may not matter, since I don't know where Duracells are made. I still have 34 of these lousy things left. Ticks me off, royally!!!(Now, let us see if this shows as a confirmed purchase."

0,Electronics,0.0,2,"I was really excited for this speaker. Got it all hooked up to my echo and was ready to go. Then I listened to the music. It has no bass. If you want something the has a good range of sound, this isn't it. It is focused on treble only. No low end. I ended up getting the JBL Charge 3. Love it"
0,Electronics,3.0,3,"great price, but doesn't do a number of things that it should. and the advertisements every time I turn it on really suck"
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Worst battery I have ever came across. Don't use for children's toys leaks battery acid. Had in my daughters mobile and the batteries only lasted 4 days when any other battery lasts a month and when I replaced them this morning I found they leaked battery acid all over.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,arrived on time just as described
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great value product!
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,"When used with AMAZON Prime and the ""FreeTime"" app for kids this is a great tablet. Recommend installing at least 32 gb of micro SD card storage and install apps to the card to insure that the tablet has enough free space to handle videos.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,They work as expected and are inexpensive.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,So far so good as far as batteries go. I order them under subscribe and save. Makes the price even better and we always have plenty for our toddler.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I love this tablet. I know it's not an iPad or any of the big tablets but it does just what I need it to do. I've had it a few weeks now. I've downloaded videos, read a few books and played some games. I've had zero problems so far. I know it's not the best video, but for the price of the tablet I don't expect it to look like my flat screen TV. I'm trying not to load too many things to keep it from slowing down. So far so good. Browsing the internet is easy too. I'm getting used to the browser and the app store for Amazon. For the price of this tablet it's not too shabby!!!"
0,Electronics,0.0,3,bought as a gift she loves it great with amazon prime
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"In all honesty, these batteries last about as long as any other brand. The only better thing about them is that they are cheaper."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,GOOD ALKALINE BATTERIES. AREN'T ALL ALKALINE THE SAME ADVERTISING STEERS SOME PEOPLE.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"As a teacher, I need tons of batteries, but I refused to spend excessive amounts on them, so I figured this was the best option! They are long-lasting, worth the money, cute (if that even matters, lol)! You won't find a deal like this in stores!I highly recommend!"
0,Electronics,0.0,3,amazon tablet is great. no google bloatware. everything is amazon. one thing i didnt like was. ads on the lock screen and no way to turn off.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Works great just what it says.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Ok
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"so far they are work well, however have had them long enough to determine if how long they last compared to duracell batteries."
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"I know beforehand that this is not a powerful tablet. But it's the best bargain at this price point . The screen is okay if you just read books, news, or surf the websites. But if you want to enjoy videos-this is not your choice.The processor is slow and the amazon app store doesn't have all the apps like you'd expect from Google appstore- even though the OS based on android. But few tweaks let you install the Google playstore-search online for the steps.Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase. Hope this is helpful."
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"Lots of batteries, but I am going through them pretty quickly. I will switch to a higher quality battery on my next order."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Everyone needs AA batteries. These are fine and a great price!
0,Electronics,1.0,3,"Fast, fluid, and lots of apps especially once I added the google play store(very simple to do and doesn't require anything that voids the warranty).

2,Health & Beauty,,3,Longest lasting I have ever used
2,Health & Beauty,,4,great value
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This tablet is small, compact and easy to handle. It's easy to figure out the main functions. My one complaint is that it does not support some big apps such as Dropbox or Google Drive."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Decent batteries...gets the job done.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"Of the four used so far, two already lost charge, one so much as giving a negative read on a voltmeter."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Work just as well as any other batteries and are cheaper!
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Batteries die extremely quick
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"still playing with it, figuring out what I can & can't do. I love the tangerine color I got. One thing for sure, some apps I have on my phone like redbox & instagram they are not in the amazon app store so I can't put them on the tablet. Wish I could."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,good deal
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I have the Kindle HD7 but wanted something between it and a 10"" tablet.The Bluetooth function lets you use a wireless keyboard, which makes things easier than typing on the screen."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great product.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Not sure about these yet. The question is whether the battery last long enough for the price that i paid for them. Will update later when i find out.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"good price, straight forward and cheaper than your local dollar store."
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"About half of the batteries won't recharge, so I threw them away"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Everything as it should be. Thank you.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This is my second Kindle and I am really enjoying it. I purchased mainly to use as a reader but it has exceeded my expectations. I can check my emails, surf the web, down loaded fb and pintrest as well. I have linked to my local library and can borrow books with ease. I have also downloaded Netflix as well. I love that I can change it to night reading so there is not so much of a strain on my eyes. I have not charged it for 2days now and have done quite a bit of reading and still showing 53%after 2 days. I purchased the 16g but plan on purchasing a micro SD card so I can expand the memory to download audio books as well."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Price can't be beat...batteries aren't great, but they're so cheap"
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Does the job. Seems to have good life. One complaint is that the batteries are in sealed groups of 4 which complicates opening them. A simple box of 48 loose would be much easier to deal with.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,So far these have performed as well as the more expensive Name Brand batteries
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Ordered the Triple AAA battery pack and I'm not sure if I got a bad batch or what but pretty much not a single battery works. What a waste of money so they definitely deserve one star.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,I think it was recargable
0,Electronics,0.0,3,We are having fun with this tablet. HD movies and games...easy to use and to read kindle books!
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I bought this Kindle because I needed something light and portable to take with me to class throughout the day on an 8-5 schedule. And so far, no complaints! Only that the camera function is pretty useless what with its low quality and lack of autofocus, or focus at all for that matter, but I knew that going in. Battery lasts all day, which is awesome since I keep all my notes on it. Touch screen might not be as sensitive as one would like, but overall? It does the job and does it well."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Great tablet with a lot of features. Great price too.

2,Health & Beauty,,3,These batteries are way cheaper on Amazon then in the stores. The batteries lasted a long time and I won't run out any time soon.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,Does the trick. This is a good tablet for the price.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"so far, so good"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great deal. They are what they are but seem to hold life pretty well. Will definitely buy again when I need to restock.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"I have had every version of the Kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a Kindle Fire. I replaced the first one I had in 2014 and it was everything I wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat. So...I got this one. First of all I miss Swype. WHY get rid of it? Secondly I cannot put two of my favorite apps (which work on my old one) to work on this but lastly and most importantly: every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code ""shimmering"" in the background and only turning it off and/or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life AND it turns itself off. It seems to happen when I close a program and move to a new one. Aggravating and not what I expect from a product with which I have been happy in the past."

0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,I purchased this tablet for my 3 year old and he loves it. He has learned a lot. Only con is that it takes a long time to charge and doesn't stay charged for long
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Pros: liked the warranty, liked that it came with a case making it cost less than buying one separately. Cons: One grandchild was too old for the games included on his locked portion. Was hoping I could put games on a particular grandchilds site and lock it so he couldn't download other things. Would recommend this only for very young children."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Good batteries for the price, they last a decent amount of time like other major brands. These came in handy near Christmas time with all the toys Santa brought. They are packaged in groups of 4 and I like how they have a container (cardboard box with cover) to keep them stored. I would definitely buy them again.they are NOT rechargeable and for some reason I thought they were when I bought them....had a brain fart or something. Good batteries overall regardless."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,very good bargain.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"The Fire HD is a nice tablet that functions well but doesn't meet the shear horsepower and feel of an iPad....but, at about 1/4 the cost, it fits the bill pretty well."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,great
0,Electronics,0.0,0,"It‚Äôs great that you can enhance capacity via a memory card, but the fact that a brand new product stops working within an hour of opening it reduces confidence significantly"
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Item is as advertised
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Good item
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I was looking for an easy to use tablet at a low price and this was a perfect match.
0,Electronics,1.0,1,"Just got this today and have been struggling with a few things. Set up itself was pretty easy right oit of the box. Had no idea I would not have access to Google Play Store. Beware, there is a much more limited selection of apps available for this device. Browsing is slow, even while in the same room with my modem. Much slower than my phone or my other tablet. Tumblr app, though able to be downloaded, malfunctions consistently. Will probably return this and get a more capable tablet, but will give it another couple of days to get used to it before doing so."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,New Kindle replaced my old Kindle that had a lot of books. To my surprise the book transfer worked well. Seems to work surfing the net. Music sound is only okay.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Living in a remote control world like I do I use a pretty fair amount of batteries, I find that these Amazon brand batteries are just as good or better than the copper top, or energizer, the price is competitive with the other brands , Kirkland, acdelco, rayovac, the preform really well in all devices, and the shelf life is great, I would recommend highly,"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Good price, work great"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Batteries are batteries.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,As expected. Batteries at a good price. Batteries come in a brown box. Inside the batteries are in groups of 4.

2,Health & Beauty,,1,"I use these for my wireless mouse on my laptop. Not heavy use at all. But I am replacing these batteries at least once a week. I have to carry extra batteries with me, and I've never done that before. I used to go MONTHS with name brand batteries, so it's a dramatic difference. I'll use these up but I won't buy them again.That being said, this is the worst Amazon Basics product that I have bought. Everything else has been outstanding, so I'm really surprised at how bad these are.I have the AAs as well, and those don't seem to have the same problem. Maybe these are just part of a bad batch"

0,Electronics,0.0,2,"At first I wanted to return this product, I bought it for my 2 yr old. I decided to keep it bc my husband liked it and of course my daughter likes it. I dnt like the fact you cant use the audible app on the kids version. I also bought it so my daughter could be independent, as far as the books none of them are read aloud. She came maneuver the games and movies tho. Its an ok product tho, I love Amazon. My daughter still likes my Samsung Tab better. Would recommend for older kids."

The Batteries I inserted into 3 items when they arrived are still working.So far I have found no bad batteries included in my order.Would recommend based on performance of the batteries I have used so far.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,I waited to write this review until I had tried nearly all of the batteries that I ordered. Most of them did not have any power in them. The few that did work lasted maybe an hour. I pitched the remaining 6 because I cannot depend on them at this point. Maybe I just got a bad batch but these are the worst collection batteries I have ever used. I would not recommend these to anyone else based on my experience.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"So far so good, will update rating when finished"
0,Electronics,2.0,3,"This is my third Kindle and by far the best. I know use this for 100% of all reading - including - and the reason I bought it, for reading in the pool. I still own 2 good tablets and a laptop. This does not compete with them. Absolutely outstanding outside in Dallas. This does not overheat, with absolutely zero glare. Yes I can read in the pool on a sunny day. I have about 300 books on this and don't charge it but once every other week. I use it 1-3 hours a day without fail. I wish the unit was truly water resistant and it's built in browser is almost worthless. This is an eReader and not a tablet."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Exactly what I needed, lots of AA batteries for a cheap price. They last just as long as any other battery so this was totally worth it. Will only buy my batteries from here now on."

2,Health & Beauty,,0,None of these batteries had a full charge. My charge detector never reached the green zone. They were one half used up. This was true for the other two sizes D and AAA.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,The price was good and so far the batteries I have used work fine. I do not have a battery tester nor the time (if I had a battery tester) to test each and every battery as others have done. I am just going to believe that they will all work just fine.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,love them work great but while charging they leaked all over the charger and had to just throw 8 of them away
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Great I brought to many
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"I don't know if I got a bad batch, but I'm getting less than two week's of use when I use them in my Baldwin Keyless Deadbolt (https://www.amazon.com/Baldwin-8252-AC1-Cylinder-Electronic-Deadbolt/dp/B00441UCY0/) which takes 4 AA batteries. The Duracell Alkaline usually last 2-3 months, so I'm pretty appalled at how short these. I'm in San Francisco and it doesn't get that cold so I don't think that's the problem.I've tested the batteries with my tester (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005G7SBY4) and it indicates they are good and in the green, yet won't drive the deadbolt.When I took the weakened batteries out of the deadbolt (that still show green) and put them in my headlamp (https://www.amazon.com/Fenix-HL23-Headlamp-XP-G2-FENIX-HL23-XP-G2-GOLD/dp/B00SH08UXY/), they only give about 20 minutes before they completely die."

0,Electronics,18.0,0,"Very disappointed that my Kindle Voyage, purchased in April, failed after just two uses. Went to charge it tonight to take on a business trip and it won't charge, won't reset, etc. Since my Best Buy receipt says I only have 15 days to return it, tried calling Amazon support. Their only solution after over 30 minutes on the phone is to process a replacement which may be a new or may be a refurbished device-- unacceptable to replace a less than 2-month old device with a refurbished one... but, given the poor experience I've had with the Voyage, I'm not even comfortable with a 'new' replacement at this point. Amazon says they can't do anything about a refund because I purchased from Best Buy-- 15 days seems a little extreme in a situation like this with a defective product!Stuck with a $200 paperweight :-("

0,Electronics,0.0,3,Only problem is that it is impossible to read or do anything on the KindleFire with any light in the room at all; far worse than impossible in sunlight.

I'm always looking for a quality product at a great price, and I really feel like these have the longevity to do that.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This is a good product but the one I bought stops working after three or four typed sentences and the Geek Squad guy told me when I brought it back that I had to go into settings and clear the data when it does that. WRONG ANSWER. That should never have to be done. He had no idea what he was doing and North Haven Best Buy didn't offer to fix or replace my Kindle. This is the third product I have had to go back and either return or exchange because it wasn't working properly or at all. One manager tried to excuse the store by asking me if I understand Best Buy doesn't actually manufacture these products. If that is the best they can do to explain why they, as the Point of Sale, keep selling defective products, the North Haven store has a big problem."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,good value here
2,Health & Beauty,,0,2 out of the 8 batteries popped while on the charger. I got battery acid all over my hands trying to get them out and cleaned up.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,They work but dont last as long as better quality batteries
0,Electronics,2.0,2,Screen larger than phone. Visual better...........
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"These are the worst batteries I have ever come across. I just discovered today that mostof the batteries I was sent were dead. I put 8 batteries into a device 3 weeks ago and the batteries were already dead (energizers lasted a year and a half in the same device) I put 4 others into another device and they lasted only 1 month (energizers lasted 2 years in this device). Both devices were operated under the same conditions. I tried putting new Amazon batteries into the devices, and the devices didn't work I tried putting another set in, same problem. I then placed Energizer batteries into the devices, and they work. I essentially bought 12 working batteries that lasted less than a month in devices that used them in such a manner they would last 12x as long. Never purchasing Amazon batteries again. I would return them for being dead, but I am outside the 30 day return window."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,For the money you can't beat what you get. iPads still rule and are far better when you aren't connected to wifi but given the cost difference I think this is the best andriod to compete with it.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Bought these for the holidays and I have to say I am impressed. I thought for the price I couldn't go wrong but these things hold their charge compared to any name brand. Kids have been running them in their toys non stop and they keep on going. I will definitely not hesitate to buy amazon batteries ever again.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,I decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and I do not regret my decision at all!The only con (for those evaluating this as a tablet) is that Amazon has their own App Store. Many apps from GooglePlay/AppStore are simply not available.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"batteries.. everybody need them.. these are everybit as good as duracell for half the price, better than energizer .... very satisfied I use them for professional audio and photography..."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great price. Great packaging and working like premium batteries.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Item was just as expected, and it arrived quickly!"
2,Electronics,,2,I have owned the product for about a month and it is as advertised. The case only opens about a third of the way. I have always had computer bags that opened fully. It it inconvenient to have to wrestle with the laptop trying to fit it through the small opening. I recommend spending few extra shekels and buy a case that fully opens.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Do not last as long as Copper Top!
2,Health & Beauty,,3,It's just a smaller battery. Seems to work

2,Health & Beauty,,2,"These batteries work. They don't last as long as I'd like but they do work fine. They came in frustration free packaging that I ended up needing scissors to open because they batteries come shrink wrapped in a little box and getting the plastic off of the batteries was NOT frustration free. So, three stars because they work but aren't great. I will probably not re-order these."
0,Electronics,0.0,1,Good for reading but video quality is not so good.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great product. Great price. Packaged well.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"If you are in the Amazon ecosystem, the Fire HD8 is a great choice for an inexpensive tablet. Very responsive, good screen, and so far the battery life has been great. The only drawback of the Fire is the apps are only available from the Amazon App Store, not the Google Play Store. For example, there is no Gmail application to install. But that's not what I use this for... Kindle reading, Netflix viewing, occasional Facebooking and light web browsing are well suited to this device. Can't beat it for $89."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Fantastic bargain and holding up well months later. I go through a lot of batteries, like almost everyone nowadays. So I searched for a better deal. I think I found it here. A big savings over grocery store batteries."

0,Electronics,2.0,3,"Really only wanted a kindle for downloading and reading books whilst traveling overseas.Seems to be OK so far, battery life seems good, relatively simple to operate, nice clear screen. My wife bought a Nook at the same time and I have to say downloading books for that seems far easier and less complicated than the Kindle Fire"
0,Electronics,60.0,3,"I am a power user; there's no other way of putting it. I work in IT and I research the heck out of products before I buy. I had an iPad Mini 2 that was just not up to snuff with iOS 10 so I sold it and bought (and eventually returned) the 2016 Fire HD 8. First let me say it's a great tablet for the price and for probably 50-60% of tablet users who surf the web and watch Netflix. It also helps if you are a heavy Amazon content user. For me, I was spoiled by the retina display on the iPad. The 720p display is alright, but you can see the pixels. 189ppi is pretty low by today's standards. The other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display. It's glare city on this thing. Display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point. If you don't play really heavy games (which it even plays Titan Quest surprisingly well!) and you don't mind not having an absolutely beautiful screen I think it runs and works fine. It just wasn't for me. I bit the bullet and went with a 128GB iPad Air 2 as its on special at BB for super cheap right now."

2,Health & Beauty,,1,"I love Amazon, but these aren't at the same level as the big brands. I use them in some monitoring devices in my home. Typically I would need to change these every 3 months, but these are lasting about 6-7 weeks at best. They're ok, but just don't have the life expectancy I need."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Work great, nice price, great service."
2,Health & Beauty,,2,These batteries are just adequate not super strong as advertised.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,We bought this Fire HD to replace an older model and the kids love it. Ease of use and the integration with Amazon Prime makes the product worth every moment. It is mostly used to watch movies and play some games so it works well for what is needed. Great for the price but if you need more options as far as productivity goes you may want to stick with an iPad or Galaxy Tab.

2,Health & Beauty,,3,Great price. They're batteries.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I was hesitant to buy a Fire tablet but I just needed an extra around the house tablet and I was very impressed. If you need a tablet just to browse the internet, watch movies and light basic searches its perfect."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Good so far. I've not done extensive testing, but these seem adequate and the price is right. Definitely better than some other store brand batteries (Bass Pro Shops I'm looking at you) I've tried. They seem on par with major brand batteries to me, but that's a completely subjective evaluation."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,OK for the price.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"A great price, to be sure...but EVERY flameless candle I have put these into has been very dim. When I replaced with Duracell (and local grocery store brand as well) the candles are noticeably brighter. Don't think I'll be buying AmazonBasics batteries again soon -- which is a bummer. I have always been impressed with Amazon-brand products but these batteries are all that."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,After one use in a regular used battery powered item it's dead. With other brand I can use the item several times before I have to replace the battery.

2,Health & Beauty,,0,"Update 4/30/16:I've been trying to use up the last of the batteries and two more have been found leaking acid since the previous review. I didn't want to just throw them out but at this point is isn't worth the mess and damage to devices.Original Review:Bought two packs of these on subscribe and save in the last couple months. We play laser tag and the guns require 6 batteries each so I thought this would be a good source of cheap batteries for our 8 guns. I put these in about a week ago after having the batteries sitting on a shelf for a couple months. We played a game and then put the guns up. The next time we played ( about 3 days later) I noticed an oily liquid running out of one of the guns. The battery was leaking acid and it had run out of the battery compartment and was all over the outside.I get that it happens to other batteries as well, but that's usually after sitting in a device for months, not a few days. I would not trust these in anything expensive...and take them out immediately after use. I won't buy again. Sorry, no pics...I was busy cleaning up the mess."

2,Health & Beauty,,1,I've had several of these 'fail' long before they should have. Several instances of having to replace them much sooner that competitors batteries.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"I purchased 2 others for my 5 & 6yr-olds, and my 3yr-old niece enjoyed playing theirs so much I then bought this one for her. The included 1yr subscription to free-time is awsome for the kids! Parental controls are great, and included apps are helpful.The lower rating is because the charging port was extremely loose, as the cord falls out ALL the time! Very Frustrating!"
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Just installed, but like it so far. The picture is clear and the price is affordable."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Good buy!
2,Health & Beauty,,3,good product
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Ive been buying these since they started selling them. The last batch, I had one that leaked. It was in a rather expensive candle, so a heads up for those using this battery to check once in a while. Ive never had this happen before. It turned all brown on one side and could have ruined my candle if I didnt clean it out real good. The battery was only week old, used infrequently in an air conditioned home. I will still continue to buy these."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great price and last a long time.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Very satisfied.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Perfect alternative to super market batteries
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"Not the best, not the worst. Less life than some batteries but price is right."
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,0,Hard to connect to the internet. Extremely slow to load apps. Not many free apps like apple. The only thing I really like is the protection it offers.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Not sure why they won't recharge correctly. Second time this happened with Amazon. Going back to a brand name.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"very good batteries at an amazing price, tip of the hat to amazon"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Dura-amazon does a good deed. Perfect. Hight performance. Just like any other BRAND ( - not the Costco version they don't last!).BRAVO! Dura-AMAZON!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,The proof of their value will be how long they last once in service.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,All of the AmazonBasic batteries are great. i am stockpiling all sizes because i can afford to at this price and having these at the ready is highly pleasing to me the neat freak. i also suspect these are fresher than ones you pick up at other stores that have perhaps been in their warehouses for a period of time. i got some from such a source and nothing powered up and then when replaced with AmazonBasic batteries my battery candles lit right up. Great Buy and in good quantity.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,very disappointed in these!
0,Electronics,0.0,3,The tablet is great for young children. They really enjoy. It can be slow at times and they get frustrated when that happens.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,great
0,Electronics,0.0,1,"It is too heavy for its size! I purchased it to replace a larger Nook, and find that it weighs as much. Screen is attractive but it even with a good signal in public places, hanging on to Wifi is difficult. It is not efficient when downloading (buffering, buffering...) and I am still debating returning it for another tablet."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Good product, service and price"
2,Health & Beauty,,1,The batteries do not last nearly as long as other brands.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"I see that these batteries have lots of positive reviews. My experience has been poor. I put a pair in the sensor for an outdoor thermometer. They lasted about 2 weeks and when tested, showed very low power. Replaced them with a second pair. They lasted and tested about the same. These may work better in indoor uses, but they seem to not like the cold. I've had way better success with rechargeable."
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,"This tablet has been very satisfactory in functionality. Good cushioning on the outer case (better than another tablet I had purchased previously), still pictures & video are pretty good. No problems with accounts, parental controls & wireless connection. Overall a good tablet for kids."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,don't hold a charge - have to recharge too frequently
0,Electronics,0.0,2,Tablet stopped working after owning for two weeks. Came back on after an hour.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Adequate performance. I just pulled 16 batteries from four night lights. Half of these were the AmazonBasics AA batteries. Not surprising until I tell you that that AmazonBasics batteries were the last to be installed and the other half were installed long before the AmazonBasics. I don't think I'll buy these again.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,None of the batteries work
2,Health & Beauty,,4,as described
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"Its fast, connects well, every amazon aspect of life you could possibly want is on here. Thats what I didnt expect, it being my first tablet. Amazon gets in your face about all its promos and products every time i turn it on. Its so annoying. -But its very handy, very sleek, easy to use and connects quick to any wifi acess around. However its limited on games and its app store is c.r.a.p compared to android. So ehhh 50/50."
0,Electronics,0.0,2,Brought this for my 8 yr old son. He cannot put it down. Would recommend this product.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,for 33 dollars its a great option. although it was a black friday special its perfect for kids especially considering the amount of damage it can handle!

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I know many people who have a kindle. It frees up using the cell phone memory, so I bought this one for the amount of storage it has, as well as the cost of the item. Thank you."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This is a great tablet for my 3 and 5 year old and I don't stress when they get dropped because of the protective case!
0,Electronics,0.0,0,Hard to connect to the internet. Extremely slow to load apps. Not many free apps like apple. The only thing I really like is the protection it offers.

2,Health & Beauty,,0,They don't last. I would not buy again
2,Health & Beauty,,3,So far hasn't been bad but there have been a few batteries with really low life span.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,great
0,Electronics,0.0,3,We bought this for my Mother in Law for Mother's Day. She's not very tech but she's had no problem using.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good product and price.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Work great at a great price
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"We recently bought this tablet for my 3 year old son and he loves it! It is easy to use, have lots of apps available, the cover is durable and it comes with a 2 year warranty! The only problem for us is the battery won't last.. Overall an amazing tablet!"
2,Health & Beauty,,3,You get a lot for a great price! I mainly just use them for my xbox one controller and they last for quite a long time!
0,Electronics,0.0,3,You can't beat the price. Great deal for what you're paying.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"When I think of all of the money that I've spent so far on batteries, I am actually a bit furious! I buy batteries for all sorts of things for my family. And to think, these batteries were here all along, and I should've bought them along time ago! Amazon basics batteries are definitely worth the buy! not only do you get the size that you need when you need it, you get enough in a simple package that meets the demands that you need, easier open, and, worth the price! For the same amount of batteries that you get even in the smaller package, you would pay quite a bit more for the larger more popular brands that are out there. These batteries perform just like the others!These of been tested in everything from small toys, two Xbox controllers. Please do not die unexplainably or unexpectedly and they just plain work!I'm ordering a larger package I think but the Subscribe and Save option is great for monthly restocking or a staple item used all the time!"
2,Health & Beauty,,0,They fail earlier than brand names. I assumed Amazon would match in beat others. I won't order again.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,My 5 year old loves her Kids Fire Edition Kindle! Very easy for her to use.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good deal for rechargeable. They all work and seem to preform well.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,I love it.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I am familiarizing my self with no conclusion to say something about it now.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"It's easy to use. I can check my email, play games from AppStore, headlines news, amazon deals & offers. Very reasonable price."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This was a birthday gift for a family member who loves to read books. Couple this with Amazon gift cards and the library is endless!
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"..exactly what I wanted, but the battery drains FAST when on hands free mode."
2,Health & Beauty,,2,They're cheap for a reason - they don't last nearly as long as Energizer or Duracell's from what I've noticed.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Nice
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Be Careful with this one - I put 4 of these into my TV remote and almost immediately had one pop. I could hear a sizzling sound within the remote and I immediately took out the battery carrier (I inserted them in proper polarity). One of the batteries was actually fizzling at the female end where it had split and was leaking. Unreal.... I've never had a battery do this before. I will NOT be ordering these ever again.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,2,I am happy so far with this tablet. It offers great protection for use with kids but is a little pricey for the lackluster performance. Great for kids.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"The Parental Options need some work. You can't even log in to a child account until you have Apps loaded for them to use. Also a kid's login doesn't have access to pre-loaded apps (like the calculator). Seems really odd to me that you can't give them access to basic functionality of the tablet.Otherwise, the tablet itself works great."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,As expected. Like the box they came in.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Best value I've ever gotten on batteries. They last as long as a Duracell at about 1/8 the price
0,Electronics,0.0,2,Got this for my 10 year old grandson. He really likes it a lot. This is good for kids to learn responsibility using tablets.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,2,Limited activities for my son to surf the web and do the things he likes to do!
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,It doesn't get five stars because there is an issue with the plug in for the charger. It won't plug in all the way it stays loose and comes out. Other than that it's just with my grandson want it he loves it!

0,Electronics,0.0,2,Great sound..easy to connect..problem is.. its not voice activated..so u have to push the wake button anytime u need to use it..that means it has b close at hand...
2,Health & Beauty,,3,These batteries are awesome for kids toys that don't have moving parts and only music. Also works great in remotes and things like that. Great value for what you get. Would definitely recommend to a friend.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I mainly bought this so my daughter and I could skype daily, but the free time by amazon has proven to be very helpful for kids. The big foam cover is awesome if you have a destructive kid."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"It's a mini computer packed in a handheld devise. Applications load quickly and I am able to get my work completed, while riding the commuter rail."

2,Health & Beauty,,3,Great price to replace all those batteries in electronics. Seems to last about as long as the major brands.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Okay
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Standard batteries at a better price.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great deal and good batteries.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"Works well. But does not offer access to the apple or android App Store. Without the apps that I need, this tablet is not as useful."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Amazon fire tablet is great and easy to use. Good value!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,as expected
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"For the price, it's tough to get a better tablet than the Kindle Fire. It's not the same quality as higher priced tablets, and you're locked into Amazon's ecosystem, but if you're an Amazon Prime member and are looking for an affordable tablet, the Kindle Fire is a good choice."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"My nephews love to play with my phone. Now as anyone who has been around small humans knows they have an astounding ability to perpetually have something sticky on their hands. However, if its a rare case where they don't they will probably drop the device from the lack of said stickum. The kindel has come to my rescue as it has everything they need to be entertained. And best of all it lacks the anxiety inducing price tag for that moment when the kids demonstrate Murphy's law in action."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Seem to be working out as promised. I just purchased them within the lst month and used reviews of others to choose them.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great value
0,Electronics,0.0,1,We have only had this product for about a month and there's already a problem with the charging port. Having to send it back. My Daycare owns 3 of them for her own children and their having the same problems with two of there's.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"Shortest life batteries ever, waste of money"
2,Health & Beauty,,3,They seem to have some good staying power and are cheaper than most other brands. I highly recommend as this box lasts quite a few months with the kids mainly using these for xbox controllers.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Price was right and so far they are lasting as long as name brands.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"May have been a fluke, but these lasted not even 10 minutes in two very different devices - a kid's toy and wireless mouse. Will just pay extra next time for brand name batteries."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Beware these batteries - I just packed them up for returning hated to have to do so but they lasted only 5 hours in tiny flashlights for my grand kids !!! Big disappointment too - won't buy this brand batteries again...nor do I recommend them to anyone out there !
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"I tried these thinking they were much less expensive than the brand name batteries and they would likely last a similar amount of time. I was wrong. I primarily use these in remote controls. While I don't have specific test results, the Duracell batteries would last well over a year in my Dish Remote. I purchased these in February and have already replaced the batteries twice. Perhaps I ended up with a bad batch, but I won't be trying these again."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,excellent price for these batteries.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,I wish it has some more of the apps from the play store some are just not there
2,Health & Beauty,,3,They Work as a normal battery would I would compare them to Duracell in lifecycle.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"Came with only 12 of the 36 batteries in the box. Someone can't count. Two previous orders came with all 36, which warrants a 3 rating overall I suppose."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Great little tablet, easy to use for kids. Wish the battery was bigger. Overall not a bad purchase."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,They do the job.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Great HD features. Makes it easy to travel with and be on the go and see all your shows.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"With the recent promotion for the Amazon Fire HD8 tablet, I just had to get one. It's been a while since I bought a tablet and the one I currently have is getting to be very slow.The tablet will come with a micro USB charging/data cable and a wall adapter.The tablet itself has some weight to it compared to the kindle tablets but won't be a problem if you use it to read sitting up. Initial setup was very straight forward. Once you connect to the WiFi and login to your Amazon account, you should be in the FireOS interface. The tablet is bundled with Amazon apps so everything is just a few swipes away on the screen. The interface itself, is very smooth so I didn't notice any lags at all. I did try a few games and there were some that were a bit slow at times and this was expected from a tablet at this price range. I will mainly use it to browse online and watch videos so don't see this as a huge setback.The buttons, charging port and headphone jack are all on top which will need some getting used to since most devices I've used had side buttons for the power/volume and charging/headphone ports are at the bottom. To the left side are two speakers and there's a micro SD card slot on the right for those who need more memory. The memory card option will be handy since this tablet is only 16GB and I think you have about 11-12GB free out of the box."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Batteries....lol
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This was a great tablet, but I downgraded to the 8gb because it was cheaper and I could expand the memory at any time."
0,Electronics,1.0,3,"I had an old Sony e-reader that I loved but it wasn't working too well anymore. I decided that a Kindle was the only viable replacement on the market right now. (Looked at Kobo also). So far, I like it. Great screen, backlight on mine doesn't have the problems that others have complained about."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Received on time and worked as advertised.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good product.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,They last a very short time once in use. Put fresh ones in a soap dispenser and they lasted 8 days. Other brand lasted 2 months
2,Health & Beauty,,3,good
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Easier than going to the store
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great batteries at a great price. Very comparable to Costco batteries.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Works well, some issues with installing Google Play apps. Great battery life"
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"OK for general use, fairly cheap, esp compared to lithium. Consumer Reports lists Kirkland from Cosco as better performers and about the same price. I'm gonna try them next. Of course being delivered to your door in a hurry is always great."

0,"Office Supplies,Electronics",0.0,3,"This is my second Kindle and I love it! It's so convenient to be able to carry around hundreds of books without the bulk and weight of literally carrying around hundreds of books. I just wish I could have bought accessories at Best Buy.

2,Health & Beauty,,2,they ARE BATTERIES get real
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I bought this orange Fire Hd8 on Black Friday so it was at a great price. My husband likes it a lot. It was purchased as a replacement for his previous Fire 7 tablet that was having charging issues. I've heard of a several others having the similar issues so hopefully this model lasts longer and has an improved charging port.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Love it
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I have been holding off buying one of these for years, but on black friday the price was an astonishing $49. The amount of tablet you get for that amount of money is unrivaled. It is a great investment if you enjoy books or media."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great price for this item.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,With the Amazon fire tablet you get everything you would expect in a high-end tablet for less than $100. That's hard to beat!
2,Health & Beauty,,1,After several months of use the batteries have proven unreliable for production use in microphones. Duracell and Energizer are much more dependable have a reliable run-down pattern.However they work fine for in-home toys and games where you want cheap batteries on the shelf for instant replacement.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,so far so good for what you get for the price
0,"Office Supplies,Electronics",0.0,3,First kindle debated between this one I got and the back lit version. Very pleased It's compact easy to tote. Using at the beech this week.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great price point and reviews for item.

2,Health & Beauty,,3,It work
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Another great product from amazon. I also use their rechargeable AA batteries which last a lot longer than any Energizer or Duracell that I have ever used. When it comes to any common battery size (AA, AAA, C, D, etc.), I will only be using AmazonBasics. Give this product a try and you won't be disappointed. You can't beat the price and/or quality."
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,2,"At first I wanted to return this product, I bought it for my 2 yr old. I decided to keep it bc my husband liked it and of course my daughter likes it. I dnt like the fact you cant use the audible app on the kids version. I also bought it so my daughter could be independent, as far as the books none of them are read aloud. She came maneuver the games and movies tho. Its an ok product tho, I love Amazon. My daughter still likes my Samsung Tab better. Would recommend for older kids."

Well my Two year old and five year old went tap crazy, like a Kangaroo on a Pogo stick. Needless to say the ran out of room quickly. I tried to teach them to not launch apps that weren't installed but they still have a problem discerning what is installed and what isn't. Aside from this, it is a fantastic device for kids to play and learn with. I especially like the parental control features. I just wish they would put in a feature for controlling what gets installed."

2,Health & Beauty,,1,"Maybe mine is a bad batch, had a serious leak on one of them, these batteries seem to last as long as duracells but duracells never leaked in my experience"
2,Health & Beauty,,3,These batteries work great. I would say comparable to top brands. We've used some for approximately one month and they are still going strong.We are currently using them in our game controllers and a clock...Will update as needed
0,Electronics,0.0,3,The amazon fire kids is amazing .. great games already loaded tons to chose from . Able to have dual users where she can only play games that are age appropriate without accidentally getting into an unwanted app
0,Electronics,0.0,3,this product is great for kids under 10 years to learn and grow. I like the fact that it is created with kids in mind
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"I primarily use these for my noise cancelling headphones and wireless mouse. Overall, for the price, this is an okay product. I do not get the longevity I received when buying other brands, but for the price and quantity it seems to all equal out. I would not recommend using them for vital devices nor rely on them in emergencies."
0,Electronics,1.0,3,"Great Amazon tap, you can take Alexa anywhere. Love it, can do the big Alexa can do and more! No know issue safer..."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,Decent tablet for the price. My kids love them!!!!
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Very nice tablet for low price. The shell feels a little on the cheap side but added a cover (Fintie) & feels much more sturdy. Great for reading or watching netflix or amazon video.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Overall sound is not as good as Echo, my primary source for Amazon content. However, the Tap is great for medium volume music and radio stations and as an alarm clock. It's portability sets it apart, however, it's nice to be able to take it from room to room and to the garage and patio without disconnecting. Recent software update now allows listening mode. It does require a brief pause after saying Alexa wake word, but it does work. This drains the battery more quickly but you can keep it in the charger base or toggle off listening mode at the touch of a button. The portability and voice activation now make this a worthwhile addition to my Echo, which is fabulous!"

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great Value!
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Battery Ninja tested these AmazonBasics AA's in toothbrushes I did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power (mWh), but that they do not carry as much energy as others. The test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others, at least in the toothbrushes. There were no test results vs. digital cameras, photo flashes, or toys, so I'm extrapolating that these will perform like Rayovacs, not like Duracell Coppertops."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,This is a great little tablet for my son. It is easy for him to navigate through and it also has parental controls . I can control how long he uses it and what he reads.
0,Electronics,0.0,0,"The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable."

0,Electronics,0.0,1,Tablet had trouble from the begging it kept restarting and rebooting I had to return it.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,"My 10yr old stepdaughter wanted a camera, but after Christmas, Best Buy was out of stock. We thought this was a good alternative (she gets $ from her grandparents, so it was her purchase) since she broke her old tablet as well. Due to her being behind 2yrs in school, we set a 2 hr limit - meaning she had to read or do other educational games for 2 hours before being able to play on it. We also set a max time so she wouldn't spend all day. It was REALLY easy to set this up & I wish it was this simple on our other kids' electronics. So, yes I had an alterior motive for moving her to an educational tablet in lieu of a camera, but some kids refuse to get outdoors. So far, a great buy!"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,They are batteries and they work well and they are a bargain! What else can you ask for :)
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"I ordered these mainly to use in a set of small LED flashlights. I tried the batteries in three different flashlights, but they didn't work in any of them. I double checked polarity and they were correctly installed. I tried them in a different device didn't work in that either. Amazon sent me a second set free of charge. They still didn't work in any of the flashlights but did work in a remote control and a toy. (I tried a different brand of batteries in the flashlights and they worked fine.) So it was hit and miss with these AAA batteries--2 sets of them. I've used Amazon AA with no problems."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Happy with the purchase, found it on sale could not pass it up!"
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"First, I would like to say I own iPads, iPhone, and many things Apple. Second, I also own many android devices. The main reason for this tablet was to take advantage of the lending library that comes Amazon prime. Over all I would purchase this over an iPad mini any day just for the value alone. At first I thought the display wouldn't be up to snuff compared to my iPad, but for movies and reading, it was good enough that it doesn't take away from the experience. However, there are a few annoying ""features"" that are on but can and should be turned off. The ""on-deck"" is a great feature, but I would have liked to have known it was downloading tons of movies in the background, eating up space and bandwidth. A better function would have been to let us choose what to download, instead of getting movies Willynilly. Be sure to turn this off when you get your tablet or it will run slow, and you'll be thinking the tablet is slow. Ok on to kindle for reading. Unfortunately, reading isn't as great as I thought it would be because it doesn't allow scrolling. Works on kindle devices but not on kindle fire devices. If you don't mind flipping the page, then you won't have a problem, but for me, can read much faster by scrolling. One last point, most of the apps aren't as polished under the ""Amazon Store"" as in the Google play store. I know this because I have an Nexus phone and compared them. For example, the Hue app doesn't even work from Amazon Store. Anyway, this point shouldn't deter you from buying it cause there are solutions."

The ones that did not work have little juice to them or some are just dead.Sucks because when I ordered AA batteries from the Amazon brand a while back they worked amazing and were of great price. These are cheap but when you factor in how many of them you can actually use this was not a cheap buy at all.

0,Electronics,10.0,3,"Love it for my boys! We received the 6"" Kids Edition for Christmas last year. The screen cracked a month ago and Amazon promptly replaced the device without incident. Great 2 yr replacement plan! Shortly after that, my older son who previously used a Nook finally broke. I decided since younger brother had a Kids Kindle, that we would purchase a second one to replace the Barnes and Nobles Nook. I love the fact that I can control what is on his profile. I love that it uses a micro usb charger and the warranty was the biggest selling feature. My boys are 5 and 7 and they are not very careful sometimes. My son did however get a kindle with a Pink case because it was all that Best Buy had in stock. I wish that cases were cheaper and I would gladly replace it. Best tablet for this age and in this price range.Cons: No google play store, slow sometimes, have to re-download apps frequently when running out of space, lack of popular apps."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great batteries as always
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"A day or two after these batteries arrived, I installed several of them in toys and our small keyboard (which also has A/C power). The next morning, my son called me into the living room, Mom! There's chocolate sauce all over the 'piano' and the table. It wasn't chocolate sauce. It was battery acid. As he said, good thing I didn't taste it!For what it's worth, the keyboard was plugged in, and it had not been turned on or played since the batteries were installed. The five new batteries were in place for about 18 hours before the leak was discovered.The green seal fell off of two of the five batteries as I removed them from the compartment. The acid left a 2 stain on my table.The other batteries that I installed that day still seem to be okay, although I've developed a paranoia about checking them! I have used Amazon batteries in the past with no problems, which is why I'm giving 2 stars, instead of 1. The attached photo shows the rings that fell off. (I wish I'd taken a photo of the puddle they left on the keyboard and table, but I was too focused on clean-up to stop and take a picture.)You'll also note that these batteries are darker in color than the product image that is currently shown. They came this way, and I'll use that difference to keep an eye on their performance/durability."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,I purchased these a little more than skeptical about how long these would actually last. But 100 battery pack at about 20 that's a pretty great steal and I figured if they run out fast well I have a 100 to go through. So I said why not and bought them. They arrived and I put them to the test since apparently all gizmos and gadgets require like 4 of these bad boys.I can not even describe how pleasantly surpised I was with these. They come in a card board box which is was nice and easy to store. The batteries are wrapped up into groups of 4's. They hold a fairly long charge so you don't have to change them out too often.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Works good for kids toys
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Looks nice can't wait to try it out! Great price for a tablet.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,These might be ok for remote controls and wall clocks that don't take much power. But don't expect to use them in you digital camera.

0,"Electronics,Media",0.0,1,"I've always been a fan of the Kindle, ever since the first one came out over a decade again.I was excited about this Kindle due to the many premium features it showed - the all-metal finish, high-resolution ePaper display, backlighting, extended battery life, etc.I was significantly disappointed to see that Amazon pushes ads through the Kindle when you put it into sleep mode, and throughout the store options. Additionally, I was further frustrated by the fact that I learned there was a cellular version (available direct from Amazon) but not through the store. For such an expensive unit, to have ads with no option to disable them, seems unreasonable and like a rip-off. Additionally, the fact that this only supports wifi (not cellular or WhisperSync) makes it even more of a drawback and something I would not recommend to a friend - stick with the cheaper version.I also found annoying problems trying to get my Apple Airpod earphones to work with this device. Pairing took forever to finish or work (had to try three different times) and if the unit sits for too long, I found that I had to go through the entire pairing process again; they were not automatically connected and synced the moment I had both devices turned on."

0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,"This is a great starter tablet. Purchased for my 6 year old, it has been easy to use. Only giving get four stars because there should be a better way to control purchases. My son figured out quickly how to purchase apps. Finally figured out how to put a pin on app purchases."
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"I thought I was getting a great deal, but I learned the hard way if you don' use them up quickly, they go dead in a hurry. Extremely limited shelf life so don't buy these in bulk if you don't plan to use them w/ in 6 mo.s. If your using them in medical equipment, I'm sorry to say I'm choosing another battery. I don't like bashing an Amazon product and there's always the chance I got a bad batch but in this instance, (medical equipment) you want power when you need, I had several groans from the bfrnd about his TV remotes eating up his batteries, I thought my wireless mice were eating them up as well, so I bought another mouse, but when I put 2 fresh packs in my ten's unit 4 ea. time they started out weak then didn't last 15 min ea.. set it's time to choose another brand of battery not the product your putting it in. I did test the one's I took out before putting the new one's in. I didn't think to test them before putting them in....."
2,Health & Beauty,,1,I have no issue with the actual batteries. They work fine. My problem is with the extremely wasteful packaging. The 20-pack comes in an oversized cardboard box with two slots for 10 batteries each. They could just as easily package them in a small thin cardboard box.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Tablets have come a long way. This is much better than my piece of junk nextbook. For the 70-75 dollars, I bought this for it is great and stays on wifi much better than my old tablet. It is small enough to travel with and browses much faster online than what I used to use. The sound quality is not bad.... and I will also give a spoiler that neither style of apple earbuds will work with this. I have some cheap earbuds that will work with the fire."
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,2,Right after we bought it the charging port broke but it was very easy to get the tablet replaced and shipped to our house. It's not very operations friendly and comes with very little instruction.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,great product love it
2,Health & Beauty,,4,A+ Great Product.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,I received these batteries today and looked at the date after reading another review and the batteries are 4 years out of date. Please don't buy these.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Good value on a good amount of batteries . They work fine. Not the best, but far from the worst . Would buy again"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Excellent bargain
2,Health & Beauty,,4,great product
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great Price
0,Electronics,1.0,1,just okay! Product was for my girlfriend. Doesn't appear she uses it much except to steam music. Most of the questions I ask it I get nothing. I like Siri better.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,Good tablet but not as smooth as high end tablets. It's limited to Amazon so don't expect to do as much as an Android or iPad. I like mine and will continue to use it. I recommend using one if you can before buying.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,love the Amazon Basics.. would highly recommend them to everyone..
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great batteries for the price and I love that the large count comes in a box.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,These batteries do not last or work well. Spend the extra buck and buy Duracell.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"We have been using these batteries in some kids toys and they work fine. I haven't noticed them lasting longer or shorter than others. We normally purchase the Kirkland brand one from Costco, and these appear to be equivalent. Its great to have a large supply of batteries on hand when you have kids!"
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Not a huge fan of products that aren't Apple but this one is good. Haven't had any problems with them at all.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Just as described
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Best deal and work as expected
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I like my tablet. Been doing a lot more reading than normal with it. Only disspoinment is that my TV has automatic Chromecast and you cannot cast to it on my Toshiba TV. Works on others. TVs. I like it.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"So far so good. I usually buy Duracell, but I trust amazon... sooooo I tried these. No complaints thus far"
2,Health & Beauty,,1,DID NOT LAST LONG
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"These batteries are the worst. They leak and they die ridiculously fast. I've replaced the battery in my kitchen clock twice in the past month. They last about 6 hours of use in a Wii remote. I usually like the amazon basics brand, but these batteries were a total waste."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"My 8-year-old grandson is able to access all the games he's used to, but also many new games and videos. He finds something new to do almost every time he turns it on."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,HAVE NOT HAD CHANCE TO USE ALL OF THEM BUT HOPEFULLY ALL OF THEM WILL REMAIN IN GOOD ORDER FOR A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME MEANING A FEW YEARS OUT.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"They work and they're cheap, but Duracell lasts longer."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Does everything a regular tablet can and for the price you really can't beat it
0,Electronics,0.0,2,I like the size of this tablet. I have small hands and it fits. Needs to have a cover a little slippery. Easier to handle than my iPad
2,Health & Beauty,,4,much cheaper and just as good
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good basic batteries. Handy and inexpensive to have around.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I got my father a Amazon Fire he's never used a tablet let alone a computer. So it was a challenge. He did pretty good but ha's a hard time seeing the screen.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,great deal!!
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I bought the tablet and it is very nice. I really like the night time mode to use before bed so you can still sleep.
0,Electronics,2.0,3,"Bought this for my 87 year old mother-in-law who wanted to use something for word games, etc. She's still getting used to it but she'll learn."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,These batteries really last.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Awesome batteries best i have used in a long time
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Have not used any yet but is a good price
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,2,returning for a replacement. It got wet and quite working for a child's device it should be better made.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This tablet is great for young children. Our kids got them for Christmas so we are still trying to figure everything out. I would recommend buying an sd card with your purchase of the tablet bc storage space runs out fast.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"These batteries work pretty well. They don't seem to outlast Kirkland or Duracell, but they are a good value for the ."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Nice, won't run out for a while."
0,Electronics,2.0,3,"The amazon fire OS is not a perfect OS but it is very functional and useful for your average tablet use. I would recommend checking the Amazon store to ensure the Apps you are thinking of using on a Fire tablet to ensure you dont have any issues. The size on this one is good, the screen is not the brightest HD screen that is available, but at this price point i cannot complain."
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,"Got this for my 4 year old daughter, she enjoys playing games and reading books. A faster processor would me it better."
0,Electronics,1.0,2,"This was a good tablet. I bought it for my Gf who basically only wanted it for Netflix and YouTube. The display was good, not great. The issue we had was that it kept dropping the wifi connection. This could have been a defect in this one tablet but we returned it and got another one."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"I'm not sure if these are the same Amazon Basics batteries I purchased last time, the label is different. More importantly these seem to discharge faster or hold less power. I buy the 48 count box usually and its obvious to me already this box will last maybe half the time the last box did."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Just as good as the expensive stuff.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,I purchased the pack to use with 4 walkies i had when we went on a 4 day cruise. Each walkie took 3 batteries. The batteries lasted 2.5 days of use. And i had to replace.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Easy to use for my kids, and they really enjoy using it."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Awesome tablet for the price but the only con is that you can't get google play on it, you have to use the Amazon app store"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Ordering in bulk for batteries makes my life so much easier. I have kids, and they always need a battery for something! I have AAA, AA and other sizes on hand all the time, and I love never disappointing them! They have tons of battery operated toys and games and Amazon makes it so much easier than running out to the corner store and paying double!"
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Wish I didn't buy these. Amazon does a lot of things well but batteries No. Not so much. These do not work for more than a moment. Lay the extra for name brand.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,price
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Works just fine
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This tablet has been great. Although I recommend getting a memory card so you have no storage issues!

2,Health & Beauty,,4,These work just as well as the top battery brands.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Batteries seem like any other they work and seem to last
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Perfect and what a deal - very pleased!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,They are batteries what can you say
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"I haven't done any scientific research on how long these last compared to other batteries, I can only give you my layman's experience. I use the exact same amount of battery usage every day and have tried pretty much every brand of battery (I don't hear that well so I wear headphones for my television and I wear them the same number of hours per day).The AmazonBasics batteries don't last nearly as long as any other battery. My headphones start getting fuzzy about twelve hours earlier than they normally would with any other the batteries I've ever used. I went through this package a week earlier than I would a 24-pack of either Duracell or Energizer. In some usages this might not matter but for me, it just wasn't worth it to buy these."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,great deal for the price
0,"Office Supplies,Electronics",0.0,3,"Great buy, do a lot of reading and he no glear screen is awesome while in the sun."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I bought this for my almost 3 year old niece and her dad told me she loves it! It has really cute educational games on it and is pretty much indestructible with the case on it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the charger has broken already.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I bought this tab as a birthday gift for my 12 yr old nephew who lives in India. It's very useful for him to google for important information over the Internet for his school assignments. Also, he can video chat with me using Skype.Rightly priced to be a kid's product. Resolution could've been better if its targeted as a kid's product. I think better resolution can reduce some pressure on eyes while reading documents with fine text."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Good product. Onboard storage does fill up quickly.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Inexpensive however I do feel that the power doesn't hold as much as other batteries that are around the same price like Best Buy's Dynex brand.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"For the price it can't be beat. That being said I had to return mine after a week. I just couldn't get over the low resolution screen. It works well for movies and the Web, but I needed it to also show off my photos to others."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Good amazon product.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,good
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Got on a good deal, lasts as long as the name brands."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Good size to hold while just lounging on the couch or in bed. The tablet does everything I need it to, good for the money!"
0,Electronics,2.0,0,"i Bought this around black friday for $60 hoping it would be awesome... it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro SD cards none of which were recognized and YES i formated them with every format i could think of ... Fat32, NTFS, Fat, Xfat... i even tried to have the tablet do it... didnt work... to make matters worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps... the main reason i bought this was to play clash of clans and i cant because it wasnt on the app store... i tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play COC but it didnt work... launched and played 1 time but didnt work or update after that... needless to say i returned it and bought a $250 samsung galaxy tab A 10.1 (2016 version) with S-pen and its WAYYYYY better... bottom line you get what you pay for... also hint the s-pen version has an extra 1 GB of ram over the non pen version... so you should get that if you can afford the extra $50..."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"So far I have had no complaints with these batteries. I was hesitate at first because they were cheaper than your big name brands. I figured they may not last long. But I was proven wrong. They have lasted just as long as the big name brands, and they are a lot cheaper. I buy these for work and for home. They do not disappoint me at either place."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Lot of batteries that work.Yay.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,These batteries die almost as fast as Harbor Freight free batteries. I expected top quality and got bottom quality.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"We have the smaller one, and been great. This one is even better, because of the size."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This tablet is a good one for everyday use. It is small but it has a clear image. Not sure if I really wanted one this small but its ok for now.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Batteries have great life span. Highly recommend. They last just as long if not longer than the top name brands at a much cheaper cost.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good price and seem to last.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,I am very pleased with the batteries
2,Health & Beauty,,0,These batteries have an extremely short life. Below Amazon's standards.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Lol, they work"
0,"Office Supplies,Electronics",2.0,3,"I like this e reader, but wish the screen were higher resolution. It requires decent light to look good, but it is easy on my eyes. The screen updates involve flashing the whole screen, which I noticed less over time. The advertised month long battery life is just standby time, it lasts much less if you are downloading and reading books."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Didn't seem to last long
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Wanted something with a kids mode on it so we could limit time and content. This works. Saw it for a really low price so couldn't resist otherwise we would have gotten the padded kids version.
0,Electronics,0.0,0,This product wouldn't turn on nor charge and then store couldn't locate another one for me.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,A great product! Why pay more for batteries when these work just fine and are cheap! Thanks Amazon!
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Very little capacity. They last only about 25 as long when compared with other main stream batteries
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Nice price nice quality
2,Health & Beauty,,4,I'll never buy Dollar Store batteries again! D They're great. I'd put them on par with Energizer or Duracell.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Will never buy batteries anywhere else!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,service expedited

0,Electronics,0.0,3,Thought this would be a great gift for the kids and the price was right
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Battery life isn't great, but overall for what I paid it is a good tablet for my kids. I did inadvertently purchase the wrong color and when I returned to the store to exchange it, the store mgr was a bit of a jerk and would not allow me to do so, despite being Elite Plus and being under 45 days. That aside it's a good tablet, but I was very disappointed in the customer service issue."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Seem to work fine.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,delivered as promised

0,Electronics,0.0,3,The kindle over all is great. There's only one thing I would want better and that is the speaker. My last kindle was louder. I really miss the louder speaker.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"At the price it is almost an impulse buy. I wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies, read, etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy. If you are used to an iPad, the Fire HD is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less. It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn't an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you. Let's just say, after my trip I purchased an iPad Pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children. If you have Amazon Prime, you do get some nice perks that make this a really nice item."

2,Health & Beauty,,0,"batteries suck! brand new out of box dead or close too. Change smoke alarms every month and remote batteries every 2 weeks.junk dead, 3 different boxes and sizes of amazon"
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"Use these in a wireless BT mouse. Has about 30 less life as copper top brand. Good price, but most likely will not buy again."
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"Bought it for my 3 year old son. Physically the product is amazing! Love the case around it, and how amazon replaces the product if anything happens, no questions asked. However, the software is terrible. I wasn't expecting much to begin with but its hard to consider this as a tablet when everything is limited. I only use it now to play movies from an external SD card, which cannot be played via kids profile"
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This is great if you have two kids and want to give them a tablet to play with. My problem is that my child is dyslexic and this is the lowest level reader that currently supports audible.com... that is the hardware supports audible. In order for my child to use audible I had to disable all of the family features and try to turn it into a reader... I was sad because there are lots of great family features that I had to disable.I did not use geek squad, I reached out directly to kindle support. Pre-sales, they could not tell me the difference between the free and paid family packages. I had to get to a senior person to help me figure be out why audible did not work and the to disable the family features ... even then, I could not disable the Alexa app. My child has full access to Alexa and the rights to turn on shopping.... kind of scary.So my disappointment is that Amazon does not make a kid friendly kindle that we can have audible.com on for my child's learning disability."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,great money saver! will repurchase when i get near running out.these are great to have on hand (especially when it always seems that you need new batteries for everything at the same time).

2,Health & Beauty,,0,"Don't Buy! I thought it was a great deal initially, but these batteries are drained SUPER QUICKLY. I have one in my wireless Logitech mouse and I have had to replace the battery 4 times since November, that is 5 batteries in 2 months that is ridiculous! I have started buying the Duracell ProCell Batteries, I am having much better results."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I enjoy reading with my Kindle Fire. That is the reason I purchased it. Because I do not have Wi-Fi my use is limited.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"The worst batteries that i have ever purchased. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Dont hold a charge for long and you have to buy Amazon's rechargeable pack. Doesnt work with otber brands but doesnt work with amazons either. I got this huge box and about 6 (yes, 6) actually recharge. Spend the money on duracell or energizer. I have a 4 pack of durcell with a charger and still works after years of recharging"
0,Electronics,0.0,1,"This is a good tablet for children and adults too. However there is an issue with the port and charger cable. We did not even have this tablet 3 weeks before it would barley charge. Took it back to best buy and they said they could not fox it, and imagine the port is not covered under the manufacturer warranty. So now I have a tablet that takes a couple days to charge. Its really frustrating."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Can't beat the price, no issues with longevity."
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"Never again will I purchase this. The outer cardboard box is frustration-free, but the batteries are tightly shrink-wrapped in groups of four. You need to cut into the wrap to begin to separate the batteries, pull them apart, then cut a little slice into the wrap around each battery. Then figure out how to pull each battery out of its little, plastic strait-jacket.Even if these batteries function well, the hassle of unwrapping them (12 shrink-wrapped sets of four batteries) isn't worth any cost savings."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,These batteries rock. They have one of the best performance to price ratio's anywhere. We use large numbers of them to power microphone transmitter packs in our theater productions. Those are applications where they cannot fail. These outperformed the ProCells we have been using.

2,Health & Beauty,,2,Great durability and long lasting at portion of price
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Ive been buying these since they started selling them. The last batch, I had one that leaked. It was in a rather expensive candle, so a heads up for those using this battery to check once in a while. Ive never had this happen before. It turned all brown on one side and could have ruined my candle if I didnt clean it out real good. The battery was only week old, used infrequently in an air conditioned home. I will still continue to buy these."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,These batteries are so strong it's like they have super powers!!!!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Love these batteries. Not only do I not have to go to the store for batteries but they seem to last longer then most of the batteries I have bought in the store. We use alot of batteries between my boys and their toys but also for cordless mics since my husband is a DJ. The big test that won me over was when you do toasts at weddings and announcements. We are able to use a set of batteries for more then one wedding
0,Electronics,0.0,3,It's a very good tablet for your child everyday use
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"While the Fire hd8 tablet certainly will not perform like some of the more expensive units, for basic web surfing, email, and especially shopping on Amazons web site, this tablet performs well, although it will occasionally freeze while surfing some sites. The screen resolution is what I would call 'adequate', but not on par with other high resolution (and far more expensive) tablets out there.Overall, I am pleased with this tablet-so far."

0,Electronics,11.0,0,"I purchased 2 of these as Christmas gifts for our niece and nephew. We decided to unbox them and charge them up to be ready for Christmas day. After opening them, discovered they will not allow you to install any free apps or use them for much unless registered with an Amazon account and credit or gift card. I had absolutely no interest in giving a 4 and 7 year old access to one click shopping on my account so we returned these for android type kids tablets. There may be some way around this restriction, but I didn't find it."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"What can you say, they are batteries and they work. Price was good when I purchased them.."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,I'm gonna buy some AAs on my next purchase.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I purchased these tablets for my twin boys knowing they are extremely rough the 2 year warranty was a definite plus. i purchased these in February/March I believe and have had 1 replaced. Not due to physical damage but the screen turned white on the center on 1 of them. The only issue I have is when we are not connected to wifi they are only able to access limited items such a puzzles and a few apps. i also noticed that some of them require licensing updates. Which are inconvenient only because it seems to happen when we are not near wifi. Other than that i love them and my boys love them.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"Though I have got it for cheap price during black friday, this Fire is not that great. Very bad camera and dim screen resolution. Pros:Install Google Play without any hassleVery good book reading option"
0,Electronics,13.0,3,"I was worried that it would have lag, but it didn't. I got this to replace my Kindle paperwhite (Which I still LOVE), because I wanted to be able to listen to the audio on the books as well. IT's a great little tablet that does so much of what I wanted it to do. The stand by time and play time are better than I thought they would be as well. I LOVE the blue light filter, although that takes time to get used to it if your not already accustomed to that sort of thing. The only other thing I really don't care for is the fact you can not easily add Google play store."

0,Electronics,0.0,1,"The tablet works great when the battery is charged. The problem we have is the provided charging cable connector does not seat well into the tablet's micro USB port and does not have a solid electrical connection.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,great price!!!!! Thanks!!!
0,Electronics,55.0,3,"I bought my Fire HD8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it's a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line, I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this."
2,Health & Beauty,,1,Battiers dont last very long
2,Health & Beauty,,1,Drain quick
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Best bang for your buck. All the batteries last as long as leading brands for a fraction of the cost. We've got 3 kids and we go through batteries like crazy over here. I cannot even begin to tell you how much money these Amazon batteries have saved us! Thanks!

0,Electronics,0.0,3,Nice for a smaller tablet. It's good for Internet surfing.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,These worked for about 8 hours and then were dead. What a waste!
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"For the price, I really can't complain. The life of the battery seemed comparable to other generic batteries. Great for remotes and other low use items. However, my son put these in a small indoor remote controlled helicopter and it chewed through them pretty quickly (which I expected). Again, good for the price and the right usage."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This is the best tablet you can get for under $100. I have used or own many tablets including Ipad Pro/Mini, Samsung Galaxy Tab and Nexus. They are popular high-end tablets but easily cost over $300 or $400. I was very surprised by quality of this tablet and it gives you much more than what you pay. Battery performance is great- it easily lasts over 10 hours after charge. Speakers are solid with two drivers. Performance is decent although not as fast/responsive as high-end tablets. I was bit disappointed at its low contrast display. However for its price, I cannot complain too much."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,GOOD BATTERIES
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"I have not seen that these AmazonBasics batteries lose their charge any quicker than the name brands, like other off brands are wont to do. For the price, these are a better value than other multi-packs I have seen. I will definitely keep buying these as long as they are available at these prices."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Overall great product. 5 year old can use it easily and it is great in terms of making sure young children cannot access content that is not intended for them.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,It was a good gift for the price and had many features and options
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Positives:Not overpriced and extremely user-friendly OS. Recommend that users purchase an Amazon Prime membership if purchasing this item as there are always a ton of free TV shows, movies, books, and games included in the subscription. Prices for items are also reduced. If not, there are occasional free and reduced price items; however, you have to look for them.Negatives: If you do not charge the battery on a consistent basis, there is a chance that the Kindle's internal battery will not charge anymore. This will require the user to return the item and purchase another. If the user keeps too many apps open, the performance drops significantly. The display has a low resolution and the touchscreen does not always respond as quickly as a tablet would."

0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",1.0,2,"This is the 2nd one I have bought. The first one went out before the 1 year. I contacted Amazon and the warranty for these was only 90 days.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Only AA batteries I buy!
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"These straight up don't work. I have put 6 different, brand new batteries from this pack into a controller and none of them have worked. Steer clear."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Just as good as name brands, lasts longer and no mercury."
0,Electronics,1.0,2,Basic tablet which is pretty good for its price range.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Tablet good for kids and some adults. Price and screen resolution were also a selling point.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This tablet is a great option for a child as the padded case provides excellent drop protection. The Kindleized Android is very limiting though as you cannot stream to a Chromecast and many other things you can do with a regular Android tablet (Play Store). Space is also limited (even on the large version).
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good deal
2,Health & Beauty,,3,good batteries!
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"This is my 2nd time ordering them and even though they arrive very fast and nicely packaged, these batteries only last about an hour and a half on my son's toy train."
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"I've had my Thea for three months so far and it is amazing except for some recent issues. The problem is now it's breaking (after only three months) and I have no clue why. It won't charge anymore and it isn't vibrating on full power. I'm hoping that Nymph will send me a replacement considering the lifetime guarantee. I'm kind of upset at how fast it broke though, despite how good of a condition I tried to keep it in."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great battery life for a great price.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Haven't conducted any testing so I'm not absolutely sure about how these compare for performance to Duracell, Energizer or Ray-O-Vac. Gut feeling is that they are about the same as Energizer and Ray-O-Vac in performance and I can sometimes get Ray-O-Vacs on sale at Home Depot/Lowes for a competitive price."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,great
2,Health & Beauty,,4,grea
2,Health & Beauty,,4,I bought these for my Xbox one remotes because the other brands I would buy dies way too quickly. I was a little skeptical at first because I had never heard of Amazon Basics but I'm glad I tried them. I play the Xbox everyday and the batteries have not died within three weeks. That's great quality.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Why buy any other batteries AmazonBasics does it again.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"I had hoped that Amazon batteries would be as good as their other services. Unfortunately, either we got a bad batch or these batteries are not as good as other brands. These were ordered in April and it is now August and I have had to use three sets of batteries in my mouse. Normally a set of batteries lasts three or four months. I would not recommend. Others reviews are more positive, but I personally cannot recommend this brand."

0,Electronics,0.0,2,There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,This tablet is quite durable. The pink is vibrant and it's very easy for little fingers to hold. My granddaughter loves it.

0,Electronics,1.0,3,"This is a great entry level tablet. It does not have all of the bells and whistles of more expensive tablets, however, at its price point the specs are quite impressive. This is an easy purchase for a small sized tablet or for a child. It is powerful enough and the screen quality is good enough. Overall, I highly recommend it."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Work great
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I'm a Windows person & this is not Windows. I'm still learning. I am happy with the size as it fits easily in to my purse, but I HATE touch items - I always seem to touch the wrong area (like spelling something, I go for a letter & get one of the letters next to - so it slows down my typing - one of the reasons I don't have a smartphone). All in all it's pretty good. I guess I would recommend it because it's the way this world is turning. However, they don't make a glass protective screen cover - only plastic."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,I couldn't beat the price on the AAA cells!
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"Worst batteries I ever bought. Less than one hour after installing in remote, popup on tv said remote battery low. Left them in and got about four hours more use before it wouldn't turn on the receiver. The AA's I bought seem to be fine. Not sure why the AAA's didn't last. Put 4 new ones in the remote ... we'll see how these do. The second set of four were no better than the first. Low battery warning after a few hours use (surfing dish tv program guide). All showed just over 1.5 volts before installation. Checked again when first low battery warning came up. Down to .8 volts. Guess I got an old, bad batch. Nothing but Duracell from here on out. Would not recommend these batteries !"
2,Health & Beauty,,0,These are horrible! Don't waste your money. These batteries die faster than any I've ever tried. A few hours in a Wii remote and they have to be replaced. I'm so disappointed!

You CANNOT get YouTube kids at all! No google apps. You can get some YouTube kids clones on the adult profile and add them to the kid's profile but they stink.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,Amazon kindle fire has a lot of free app and can be used by any one that wants to get online anywhere
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"Bought this for my parents as they have an aging 3rd Generation FireHD. That tablet cost well over $300 dollars but was limited to fireOS 4. I couldn't believe that their newest only cost $50 on sale with ads. I don't think it is worth it at their normal price of $80 dollars.FireOS 5 is pretty much just a skinned version of Android Lolipop. Since we are on Nougat now, they are about two years behind. Hopefully security updates are still being made for the device.The biggest disappointment was the screen. If you buy this for reading books, they really need to go back to the old 3/4 Gen HD Fire Tablets, as their screens are so much better. They claim IPS on this screen, but I don't buy it. Colors are washed out and pixel density is pretty poor.The blue light filter they have is pretty terrible compared to what Apple offers. It basically puts a semitransparent color over the entire screen. If something on the screen is already black, why does it need to look blackish orange? I don't fully fault amazon as this may be more of a limitation of Android, but still...Also I can't figure out how to get rid of the adds for the red version. In the past there was an option to pay a few extra dollars and they remove the promotion. Amazon's website doesn't offer the red without adds as of this writing, but they do with the black.Side load google play store for more up to date apps as a lot of the amazon store apps are long out of date."

2,Health & Beauty,,0,"Disappointed... In my handheld Microsoft wireless game controller these last about 1 week. Duracell/Energizers last 3-4 weeks... Amazon needs to select a higher quality re-branded battery to sell as Amazon Prime. Amazon could dominate this market by simply selling, close to these prices, a 5 longer lasting battery than Duracell. DON'T PUT THESE IN ANY EMERGENCY DEVICE... like smoke detectors, emergency flashlights and radios."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I bought this tablet to download videos from youtube red and to be able to take the tablet everyone we travel to play the videos. But unfortunately this tablet model does not support youtube red and it definitely doesn't work without wifi. So that was a fail! I'm gonna need to figure out how to download stuff so we can run the tablet without being connected to wifi. Other then that it's good for your little ones older then 3 or 4 years of age. It's big so they might have trouble holding it up but if they sit down with it then all the apps help promotes them to keep engaged and interested to sit still. Great case protector!
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Bought these for my children they love the camera on them. The last one they had didn't have s camera

2,Health & Beauty,,0,"Terrible decision on my part to trust Amazon to make even a decent battery. How hard can it be, right Batteries don't last. Every device I've used them in began to have quirky little malfunctions (remote buttons don't always work or do what they are supposed to do, mouse randomly disconnects from computer, etc.). Maybe I got a bad batch -- all 48 of them. Lesson learned."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Overall, not a bad tablet. The price is good and the features are pretty nice. It was bought as a gift and I can say that she loved it."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Love this one.It is my third kindle.My last one was a bit larger but it was a bit heavy.Love this one for reading or playing games.I can check my email and shop on line as well as take and store photos.I can also listen to music.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"These are okay. They aren't as long-lasting as name brands so in the end, I'm probably not saving money using these. That said, I like how they are packaged so they take up little space and we only have to open a 4 pack each time while still having plenty on hand. This beats the big packages of the name brands where the left over batteries end up falling out of the package and scatter in the drawer."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Right product, Right on Time."
0,"Office Supplies,Electronics",0.0,3,My fianc√©e really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend.

On the other hand, With four kids using tablets as reward time it helps the kids free time is awesome it useful"

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Thx.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,using it as a head unit in my jeep bought a rugged case and it works great
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Work well
0,Electronics,8.0,3,"The voyage is a great e reader for the avid reader. It's not a tablet so don't expect features of an internet tablet. However the auto-adjust backlight feature & minimal flash between pages makes it ideal for readers. This version includes the vocabulary builder, which I find myself using a lot nowadays. However, I'm not sure why it's more expensive than the paperwhite. That's the one I actually wanted but my local store was out of stock. I thought it included the 3g so you can download even when away from wifi but it doesn't. So that's why I'm confused on the price difference. The overall feel of it is fine. Not a lot thinner than the original. I keep mine in a case and whenever it goes idle I have to take it out of the case just to press the power button, which is pretty inconvenient. Oh and it freezes when charging which made me extremely nervous the first time because I thought it was broken but I just held the power button for like ten seconds and it was fine... other than those very minor complaints,I love it. I find myself reading way more than watching tv these days so that's always a plus!"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Cheap but seem to last as long as the Energizer ones I was using previously
2,Health & Beauty,,2,They dont last as long as certain premium brands but they do OK. I wouldnt put them in critical apps like smoke detectors but for TV remotes and toys and all the other goofy modern distractions that regularly beg for AAs they are OK.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,I didn't have any issues with these batteries dying on me but I am hesitant to make them a staple since it seems like there are others who have gotten bad batches. I will wait it out to buy again.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Batteries were packaged good and seem fine
0,Electronics,0.0,3,It's actually a very good product for a decent price. Not lightning fast but it is okay for everyday use.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"I use it for the roku remote and it runs out so fast, holds for about 2-3 weeks (just like the chineese batteries),"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,I love that it comes in a box. So smart for batteries. You don't have a lot of loose batteries like you do once you open a blister pack.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"I had such a good experience with Amazon D batteries that I ordered some of their 2A batteries. The 2A batteries seemed much weaker out of the box. When I changed out a pair in my clock today, they had leaked and were stuck together. Making it difficult to remove them. I looked at the packaging for the new ones and noticed that they were made in Indonesia. After reading the reviews, it seems like it may be a matter of luck whether you get really good batteries for the price or really bad batteries at any price. I like to play blackjack so I will probably order one more time to see how lucky I get."
0,Electronics,1.0,3,"I like the shape and size of this Kindle, and the graphics are good. But if I play a game for very long the charge seems to run out pretty quickly. It is very good for books and for music. I would recommend it for those categories."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Tablet good for kids and some adults. Price and screen resolution were also a selling point.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Great tablet for the cost, does all the basic functions great. These are email, web surfing, and social media. If you belong to Amazon Prime then it's even better since this thing makes it easy to take advantage of the extra content you can access. Movies, TV Shows, music, books. A lot of this is free for Prime Members. Good idea and business move for Amazon as it encourages Amazon content and purchases. The tablet itself is pretty good, smaller and more narrow than an iPad. Easy to hold in one hand, screen is nice for video, reading, web surfing and email. If the iPad is setting the bar and is a 10, I would give this an 7-8. The weakest thing is the camera, it adequate but you smart phone is better. A feature it has that the iPad lacks is the ability to add an Micro SD Card for extra space. It is also much cheaper than an iPad."
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Two of the batteries were already dead. The rest work fine.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"I love the volume price, but these batteries don't seem to last as long as the Dollar General alkaline batteries I typically purchase."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,You can not beat the price and it is by a trusted name.

0,Electronics,1.0,3,"We previously bought a 7 inch, 8 GB Kindle for my son which he used a lot. Eventually though he dropped it and it no longer worked. This past Christmas we purchased the Amazon Fire HD8, 16 GB.This model was an improvement over the previous one. With twice the internal storage, my son wasn't always coming to me to delete games because he ran out of storage. Another great feature is the external SD card slot. We bought a 32 GB card and he's not had to delete anything.The quad-core processor is a big improvement over the previous gen model. Apps and games load quickly with not lag in running them. There also seemed to be an improvement in the battery life so it doesn't have to be charging all the time or plugged in the the power cord.This is a great purchase for any child!"
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Good for the price. Last longer then DollarTree batteries and cost about the same.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This kindle is awesome. I love the design of it. Nothing software wise that was different than my other kindle but the way it's designed makes it much more comfortable and easier to read. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of the price. If it were cheaper, this kindle would have been five stars no doubt."
2,Health & Beauty,,1,Only lasts half as long as the Rayovacs i usually purchase.......
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Cheap and work great!
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Every single battery leaked battery acid after the first few charges or uses. Some while in the device it was powering and others while in the charging station. I thought perhaps it could be the charging station I was using so I purchased another brand but it didn't make a difference. I also never left the batteries in the charger once they were fully charged. This happened with the AAA batteries I purchased as well. And when I say leaked battery acid I'm talking about literal puddles of acid that would pool under the charging station or begin leaking from the device. I had to throw away a few children's toys as well as an xbox 1 controller. The skin on the tips of my fingers peeled away a few times as well from overexposure to the battery acid after having to clean so many surfaces and devices from it getting everywhere. Please don't buy this product They are completely ineffective and its simply an unsafe product. All in all purchasing these batteries cost me around 100+ in having to buy replacements for the devices they ruined.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Got this as a gift for my mother and she's satisfied
2,Health & Beauty,,1,Don't last nearly as long as major brands.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,I mean... they work.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Bought one to replace the smaller (non HD) version. Lot faster and picture is noticeably better. Would recommend for anyone not wanting to spend the extra $50 or so on the big names.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great price and would recommend them to anyone!
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Ordered these batteries along with a wall mounted mirror. Upon inserting these batteries the light did not work. Thinking something was wrong with the mirror. I decided to go to Target and buy more batteries. Replacing your batteries my light now works. I would return them but the return date was past due. Thanks for your time.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Great for little kids the case on it is amazing. My daughter loves it. Only thing I would change is the sound a little louder and screen a little bigger.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This was a great purchase and would definitely buy this again. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is a programmer glitch. They need to fix screen where little ones can't stop or change icons while they are watching or playing games. Frustrating for two year old to stop cartoons by accidentally touching screen
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Very good value tablet. Does everything pretty well. Brightness isn't great. Battery takes a while to charge but lasts forever. Decent buy. Would recommend.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great deal!
0,Electronics,0.0,3,overall this is a good tablet. it is best with those who have Prime Amazon and the ability to watch Amazon video. a good price for a good tablet but has limitations based on the operating system. for video watching and basic use a good choice

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Batteries that seem to operate just fine at a great price.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"I bought this product from amazon about a month ago, the reviews seemed great so I gave them a try.After using the batteries in my Xbox One controllers for about 2 weeks, the controller began to malfunction.Upon further inspection, I checked the batteries, and the compartment was a little bit wet, so I cleaned it up and went to get new batteries (still in the plastic wrapper) and all of the batteries had an oily residue around them (some type of leakage) .Overall, dont save money here as you might lose your equipment and the money you spend on the batteries."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This tablet was an upgrade from the Nabi Jr for my 4 year old and she really enjoys it. There are so many apps/books/videos and it entertains her much more. The only thing i would recommend is getting an additional storage product since there isnt much internally.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Thanks great product

2,Health & Beauty,,4,I have never been disappointed by any of the Amazon products.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"The tablet is great overall. Its fast, smooth and many options to check out with regards to apps and programs. Great also if you have an Amazon account and also Kindle as well."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"There are many batteries in the box for the amount of money you pay. Batteries at the store would cost way more. They seem to be packaged well, and conveniently. I took one star off because these batteries do not seem to last as long as the more expensive batteries, but it could just be the pack that i used. I will see how the rest will work out, but for the money, i think it is a good deal."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"These batteries are a great value. I got the 48 pack and for the most part, the did not disappoint. However, there were a few that did not work. Then again, i've always been pleased with Amazon's products and will continue to use them."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Ok
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Everyone read the 1 star reviews..the 5 star reviews must be people reviewing immediately. The 10 year promise is crap. I have 48 AA and 36 AAA batteries that are all dead after 1 year. The Dollar Tree batteries are better. Pay the extra money and don't fall for Amazons broken promises or guarantees.

2,Health & Beauty,,3,ok
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"This battery is fine, but I purchased it because I thought it was rechargeable. Shame on me for not noticing, but I thought it looked just like the rechargeable ones I had purchased before. I bought it on Prime Day for about 6, so I thought I was just getting a great deal.Disappointing. I don't normally buy regular batteries, as we go thought them like water in all of our Thomas trains and other toys. I wish I had noticed the difference."

2,Health & Beauty,,2,"Packaging warning. The batteries are fine but the batteries themselves come pre-wrapped in groups of four! Every time you need more than four or if you're just going to split up some sets, you have to open a new group of four, and they come wrapped in that horribly annoying cellophane like substance that is hard to remove it must be terrible for the environment."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,I had an older Kindle Fire and thought the transition to this one would be smooth. I was even encouraged to turn in my old one one the spot. After cleaning up the old one and saving the old files on the cloud I thought....I bought this updated version to find that it does not recognize the old files....so much for it being saved on the cloud. Then instead of it having an ad whenever I turn it on....ads also clutter the screen with the apps. I was happier with the older model and regret turning it in for a credit....which somehow dropped $10 in value in the time it took me to prep it before I deregistered it. If you didn't have an older model you probably will be happy with this one.

0,Electronics,0.0,1,Kindle is good as long as it is plugged into a wall outlet. The battery lasts a mere 15 minutes as a portable unit. Not happy with this. Takes an hour to charge the battery to 100% yet drains in 15 minutes. There`s something mathematically wrong with this equation.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,My Fire is compact and easy to use. Mainly used to read online books at lunch time. The battery lasts much longer than previous tablet I had and charges much quicker. very happy with my Fire.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"The scale arrived earlier than expected, and came packaged nicely. No visible damage on the box, so I was excited to test it out. The scale came with batteries, which was very convenient. However, upon turning on the scale, I discovered that the entire lower line of the display failed to light up and change (I.E: an 8 looks like an A, 3 looks like a backwards F). Other than that, this scale would have been fantastic. One thing to note, the weighing platform is not silver itself, but rather appears to be a silver plastic."

2,Health & Beauty,,2,Did not last as long as expected but good value for price.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good quality.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,I am giving these batteries a 1 star because I couldn't go any lower. I tried 10 batteries in a row and they lasted bout 35 seconds then my light went out. The shelf life must have been ending. I guess the old addage You Get What You Paid For holds true.

Also it won't work with my Chromecast devices..."
0,Electronics,7.0,1,I bought this thing refurbished. I find that I have to unplug / plug back in the HDMI cable on a regular basis when switching inputs on the TV. Not sure if it is the Amazon Fire box itself or if it is the TV (Not likely).Otherwise it is a good device. I bought it for the ability to hard wire my Ethernet connection to my gigabit switch and for 4K capabilities which it does do. Having the Alexa app is handy but her features can be severely handicapped.I probably should have just bought it new..... usually refurbished devices work well as they are tested before resale and it was probably tough to catch that the HDMI port on these might be finicky. I may have to switch it out.

2,Health & Beauty,,0,Worst batteries ever. I use them in my remote and have to switch them every couple of weeks. Do not buy
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Kids love their Kindles!!! Amazon freetime allows them access to tons of age appropriate content. They love the games, apps and videos available to them based on their age. The only reason I give this 4 stars is due to the charging connectors. They are not ""kid friendly"" and the kids bent both of them upon the first time they unplugged their devices on their own. Otherwise, Kindle kids is amazing!!!"

0,"Office Supplies,Electronics",0.0,3,"Fought it for a long time, but Kindle is awesome. The newer version with adjustable light is best for me."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Good products. I like the Amazon batteries. The only reason they didn't get 4 stars is because you can't really use them in products that have a higher voltage demand. As the battery ages, it gets weaker. It lasts about as long as a normal Duracell or Energizer, but the output drops significantly as the product ages. They are great for remote controls, smoke detectors, etc. Not advisable for anything with moving parts or motors."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great battery pack at a great price.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,These seem to work as well as any other name brand batteries. I would buy again.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,Best buy ever for my 3 year old. Only purchased because they were out of the Galaxy tablet. I'm glad. This tablet is PERFECT for my 3 year old. I love that it has 2 modes. The kids mode sometimes freeze and takes a minutes for apps to open. Also didn't download Netflix movies like indicated. But regular mode works great. My daughter loves watching weird homemade youtube movies anyway.
0,Electronics,1.0,3,"Pros - weight is super light, small size, long battery, I fell it to floor a few times and screen didn't breakCons - it takes half second for the next page to appear on screen when turning pages, similar to ""fade in"" animation in PowerPoint.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"As far as functionality it works well. I can surf the internet, match movies, check social media, and anything else a tablet is supposed to do. The app store has a good variety off apps. It does not have as many as the iTunes store, but there is plenty of variety. The reason I knock a star off is the constant ads. I know that this is an Amazon product, but the ads get a little annoying."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,These things really supply power!
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"I used these to replace the batteries in my digital safe. A week or two later I needed to access something from the safe, but it wouldn't open. I was sure I was entering the right code, but the safe just beeped and didn't unlock. I didn't suspect the batteries right away because they were still almost new. But eventually I plugged in a different brand and that's all it took the get the safe to work properly again. It was a big relief, and interesting to find out that AA batteries aren't all created equal."

2,Health & Beauty,,0,you certainly get what you pay for....I bought these because the cost was about half of what I pay for name brand batteries. They last about 25 as long as the brand batteries. Hmmmm...paid half for something that lasts one quarter......My financial advisor is still wagging his finger at me
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Fit properly in the battery compartment. Powered the toy properly.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great Batteries. Love the performance and value. With all our remotes and other battery demands this batteries will do the trick.

I'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my iPad back... and yes, I called Amazon numerous times... they work after the fix, but the next time they go to use them they don't work again... the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app, clearing cache then doing a hard restart... then you have to wait to restart Netflix.... oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works... if it works at all"

2,Health & Beauty,,0,I opened up this package fresh and put two AA batteries in my Xbox one controller. It only lasted for a few hours of gameplay. When I took the batteries out they seem quite warm. I used my heat gun and they were 115F. I got a new set of two batteries and placed it in my controller. They only kept the controller on for less than a minute. When I took the batteries out one burned my finger. I grabbed my heat temperature gun and in certain spots it registered over 127I'm not going to try and use anymore in any electronics. I'm not sure what's going on here Amazon.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I exchanged the paper white that I had bought for this Voyage. This is thinner, lighter and just easier to hold than the paperwhite. Still getting used to the archive system since I had a Nook before, bit of a learning curve. But I like the Kindle interface better than the Nook, the book suggestions and shopping for books is much better. The only thing I miss is that the Kindle doesn't tell you what % battery you have left, it just shows you the bar in the battery symbol."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Got this tablet for my 7yr old daughter and it has been great for her. It's the right size for her little hands. Only drawback is the you can not get google apps on it. Apps have to be from Amazon and they might not have the app you want.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"If you, like me, dont care what batteries you use in your TV remote these are fine for youPros-Um 100 batteriesThey come in packs of 4, so not loose batteries rolling aroundCons-I hear they may drain quicker than more expensive batteries. To that I say: I have 99 more where that came from."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great price fast shipping
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Batteries can be expensive! However, Amazon has taken the opportunity to sell a good quality product. There are plenty of batteries for the cost, and in these times of uncertainty we need to be prepared for our family. During times of power outage batteries are so comforting because they allow us to maintain a sense comfort. They also sell these in triple a, c, and d. The price is good compared to other brands, and the quality of Amazon is backing the product. Safe and good buy for any consumer."

0,Electronics,27.0,2,I have a Paper White 1 and 2. Honestly it is difficult to justify double the price value. I certainly like most added features but not sure its worth the extra money. To note it operates great just not sure its worth an upgrade to the latest greatest.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This is an awesome tablet for kids. Love the versatility. This is our 2nd since our older son loved his, we felt his younger brother needed one too. The charger is horrible though. Does not charge well at all. Returned the first kindle thinking it was the tablet. After the second had problems charging, I tried my husbands galaxy charger and it fits perfectly. Then we bought this one. Same problem. The charger that comes with the kindle simply does not fit well and give it a good charge. All 3 tablets had the same issue. I have also spoke to other parents who have experienced the same issue. So in summary, the tablet is aweosme. The charger is awful."

2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Pleased with the expiration dates, these are a good trade off, of cost and quality"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Thank you Amazon for providing everything I think I need!
2,Health & Beauty,,0,These batteries work but don't really last that long. You maybe get 3-4 weeks out of them. Its better off buying rayovac or energizer batteries from home depot
2,Health & Beauty,,0,not good at all
2,Health & Beauty,,2,nothing bad to say but I can get others for cheaper price.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I bought this tablet for my son so he could have something to entertain him on our road trips. It works great. I love the child-proof case that it comes with. My only complaint is that the interface is slow sometimes. I'm honestly not surprised though, because it runs off of Android. I typically avoid Android but I figured I would give it a shot. After using this tablet, I think I will avoid using Android products again. Besides the slowness of the Android OS, it is still a great tablet."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Ever since getting an insulin pump, I've been using more AAA batteries since my pump uses them. I was happy to find that AmazonBasics offers AAA batteries at a bargain price so that I don't have to spend more money keeping myself alive. Type 1 diabetes is expensive in itself and I'm glad that I can save, even if it's just spare change, on the products I need to purchase to keep my insulin pump going. I find that these last just as long as name-brand batteries and have had no problems with them. In the future I will be using Amazon's Subscribe Save program now that I know how long the batteries in my insulin pump last. Overall, I would recommend these batteries if you regularly use AAA batteries and like to save money."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,"I've been buying AAA alkaline batteries in packages of four at the dollar store and thought I was getting a pretty good deal on the price, but it bothered me to have to throw away so much packaging every time I needed four batteries. Then I was checking out a fellow reviewer's profile and found a review of the AmazonBasics AAA batteries. He (or she, I can't remember) claimed these work as well or better than name brands and are even less expensive than the dollar store deals and with much less waste in the packaging.So I ordered some and his advice was right on the money. I've used them (so far) in small flashlights and in one of my TENS machines. Great performance. The price (which seems to fluctuate) is less than I was paying locally. Best of all, you get 36 batteries in a tiny cardboard box that measures 4 1/4 x 2 1/4 x 2 1/4. There are 9 sealed packages of 4 batteries each, but there's much less waste in the packaging. Amazon claims 10-year, no-leak shelf life for them, but even I use batteries faster than that.I think this is a great product at a great price and I love the packaging. Glad I stumbled onto them."

2,Health & Beauty,,0,"These batteries are horrible. We depend on AA batteries for many wireless microphone and have found that brand-name batteries last about a month per our usage.

0,Electronics,1.0,3,Got this product for a relative for christmas who had a kindle fire and was looking for an upgrade. With how far technology has grown on phones she was only looking for a reader and something that was lighter on her thumbs when reading then her kindle fire. This product was not only lighter on her thumbs but also worked great in any light.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,Right after we bought it the charging port broke but it was very easy to get the tablet replaced and shipped to our house. It's not very operations friendly and comes with very little instruction.
0,"Electronics,Media",7.0,3,"I would definitely buy it again, but it does not have the ambient light sensor like the cheaper voyage does to turn the brightness up and down automatically in the dark or sun. For a product of this price, it shouldn't be missing any features. Otherwise it is great, light, and the text refreshes quickly and is crisp."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,EXCELLENT
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"My old Kindle was not working so good anymore so bought this one on a Black Friday Deal from Best Buy. Price was great. The only problem I had was that at times it did not seem to be charging well or fast. I took it back to Best Buy and they would have replaced it for me but then would have lost all progress in games I had played. The person at Tech Support suggested that I change the plug in ""brick"". He said that they have had problems with that. I can use the same plug that I use for my iphone and now it charges fine. Glad that it was an easy fix."

0,Electronics,8.0,0,I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies!
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Bought this tablet to replace a 3 year old Galaxy Tab. This tablet is quick and easy to use, relatively streamlined. The screen is nice and the stereo speakers, while tiny, sound better than my old tablet. The modified Android system that Amazon is running on this tablet is good, just a bit restrictive. All in all a good tab for general browsing and popular apps.Pros:-Price-Performance-Feels sturdy-Easy to navigate-Silk browser works greatCons:-Not all apps are supported on here, like Telegram-Ads on lock screen feel unnecessary, but not a hindrance-Not as customizable as other Android tabs"

I also installed a sceen protector, a new case and a 64GB SD card before wrapping it.She was very surprised and pleased and she noticed the big difference in speed, sound and picture quality immediately.

2,Health & Beauty,,0,You get what you pay for. They do not last very long at all. It's better to buy Duracell.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,A little more space on outer edges would be great. I only use it for gaming and have had 1 real problem. At times it kicks me out of the game (popular game from EW) Otherwise great for what I do. Needs more security. But overall good purchase for less than 100$.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,It is a lot cheaper than other tablets with all the functions I need.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Excellent purchase, especially for the price. 2 toddlers in the house make batteries a commodity item. There are excellent reviews that compare AmazonBasics to the usual battery brands. I highly suggest you read them to see that there really isn't a difference and since the price is so much lower these are a no brainer."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,don't last that long but ok
0,Electronics,0.0,2,Easy to setup. Large screen. Protective case built-in. Two year protection plan included.

0,"Office Supplies,Electronics",0.0,3,"Easy to figure out and I like the paperwhite because it doesn‚Äôt strain your eyes and you can adjust the size of the font. Bought one for my mom too and she loves it. The only con is the touch sensitivity could be better, but not bad for $60 on sale"
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Good batteries.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,good price
0,Electronics,9.0,3,"The Kindle Voyage is the best e-reader experience available. Text is super-sharp, it's comfortable to hold, the built-in self-adjusting light is awesome, and you change the page by either swiping with your finger or pushing down on the bezel. Unfortunately, all those great features come at a $199 price that is $80 more than Amazon's Kindle Paperwhite and more than double the cost of the company's entry level reader, both of which are excellent in their own right. So five stars for the device itself and minus one star for the high price."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I bought this for my sister as a gift so she need not use her laptop for basic internet surfing and to watch movies while travelling. The device speed is decent although you cannot compare the performance to a laptop. If you want to avoid carrying a bulky laptop during travel and want a budget make do device for laptop then choose amazon fire tablet.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Bought for my kids and they love them!! They love the camera!
0,Electronics,3.0,3,"I like this tablet. It has everything you want. However the apps within it need to be updated more often. If this happened than it would be top above an iPad mini. For now, it gives me enough of what I need and in HD. For $89 it was a good deal."

2,Health & Beauty,,3,So far so good. I haven't noticed them dying fast so they are much better than your off brand cheap knock off ones. We shall see how long they last.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,works great!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Item as described
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"Wry basic, but I guess, it's ok for the price. Bought for a 6 year old."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,can't get a better value.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,doesn't last as long as say duracel.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"I looked at the average rating of the major battery brands (EverReady, Duracell, Rayovac , etc). they all rate the same as these. Same complaints from the one and two star raters. I conclude batteries are batteries. So, I bought these and I've been happy with them."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Easy, friendly features that allows for uncomplicated use and function."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"of course these are no energizer bunny batteries, but for the price and amount you get, you cant beat it! They come in individual packs of 4, inside a white box to keep them in. I would recommend it"

0,Electronics,0.0,3,Nothing further to Comment. Giving as a Xmas gift.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"Battery drains quite quickly when left inside several other products I had when unused. Not sure if its cheaper than the store, but the quality is not as good as Duracell if I remember correctly. Other than that, getting it as an add on item is great because it allows me to use my products right when I get them without having to worry about making a quick trip to the store"
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This tablet is great for young children. Our kids got them for Christmas so we are still trying to figure everything out. I would recommend buying an sd card with your purchase of the tablet bc storage space runs out fast.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,We have several kindles and this is the latest version. Its packed with Amazon marketing stuff which is fine if you use them but most just take up space for us. This new version comes with 16gb but allows you to expand the memory with an sd card which is great. One problem if you have a few other kindles is that they are linked to your account so if they are for different family members/kids they may end up with the same stuff on them. My kids mainly use them for game apps and YouTube videos which am seem to work great. The sound is good and the hd video is nice. Overall happy with it and the price was good for this type of tablet.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Pretty sure they didn't really have a charge when they arrived
2,Health & Beauty,,3,works so far
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Received the Amazon Fire HD8 and it works well, BUT it is clogged up with constant ads. I had to contact Amazon to turn them off, at an additional cost of $15+tax..

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I bought this tablet for my 3rd grader, she loves it! She will be on it for hours at a time, there's a feature that allows me to put time limits which I love.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,fine
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Price was right........quality is good
0,Electronics,2.0,3,"I like this e reader, but wish the screen were higher resolution. It requires decent light to look good, but it is easy on my eyes. The screen updates involve flashing the whole screen, which I noticed less over time. The advertised month long battery life is just standby time, it lasts much less if you are downloading and reading books."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"it works well, my only real gripe is that you're limited to the Amazon store for apps and some apps aren't the real provider, but a 3rd party app that is...hokey. Other than that for $50 I can't complain."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great batteries. Work very well
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,"This Table is good for children because won't break if dropped. However, the only problem I have, as well as other people in the family who bought the same Table, is the charger port that get damaged after first few days of use."

2,Health & Beauty,,3,"These are hard to beat when it comes to price, but I have found that they do not last as long as Energizer or Duracell. They come close, I think, but definitely not as long. I use AA batteries primarily in my iMac bluetooth keyboard and mouse, for what it's worth. Still, these amazon batteries are significantly cheaper, so it all probably evens out."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Seems to be equal to any other brand of batteries I have used.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,good product but very hard to customize like real androids. Can not install firefox or other SW that Amazon deems a competition...too bad

0,Electronics,0.0,3,Great tablet for under $100. HD quality and it works just as good as any tablet.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"I was disappointed with these batteries. I thought they were going to be a higher quality and work as well as the name brand batteries. I bought these to use in my sons' leapster GS explorers. My sons do not play on them nonstop and they shut off on their own after being idle for a few minutes. These batteries don't even last 3 days. 8 hrs of use at the most! Because we can't afford to go through batteries so quickly, I change them once a week. It's really sad that they don't hold up longer. Time to go back to brand name as it will save money over these and use some rechargables. Do not buy if you plan on using these for something more than a remote or clock."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This is a great Tablet. Love the features and resolution
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great batteries for super price! I am on recurring shipment - get a box once a month.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Works as well as the Big brands, well worth the money"
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"These batteries are HYPED! Duracell always wins. I bought them for electronic circuit for my experiments and I can clearly see how they fail against Duracell AAA batteries. I also wonder about the review someone has put that shows the performance plots. Under standard conditions doesn't matter, batteries need to perform the way consumers use them. To be fair, these batteries are better but don't show them as the best in the world, no way!"
2,Health & Beauty,,1,Stay away from this brand. Doesn't last long.
0,Electronics,1.0,3,"This is a great entry level tablet. It does not have all of the bells and whistles of more expensive tablets, however, at its price point the specs are quite impressive.

0,"Office Supplies,Electronics",0.0,3,Nice and convenient just wish that it came with written directions so that I could brighten up the screen.
0,Electronics,2.0,3,"I mean, you can't argue with the price of this, but it's lacking some big name apps that I thought would have Amazon Fire versions but don't. Like Dropbox or BBC News or LA Times. Screen is great. Battery seems to last a long time. And the size is better than iPad if you're using it for reading mostly, you can hold it in one hand. I'd recommend... but with caution that you're going to be missing some useful apps."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Very quality
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"Somewhat disappointed with these batteries. They die rather quickly. I'm not using them for things that use a lot of power either. Like the remote for my TV. I have to change them frequently. Expiration date of 2026, but they go fast, unless I got a bad batch. I would rate them down there with cheap Rav-o-vac or a grocery store brand."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,This is the best iPad cover ...you can't beat it
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"These are cheap batteries. To make matters worse, Amazon sends old DEAD batteries mixed in with newer ones and ship them off to you. At least half of our last (and final) package had dead batteries and worked for maybe a day. Amazon wouldn't return our money for them. WASTE OF TIME."
2,Health & Beauty,,1,These batteries do not have a long life.
0,"Electronics,Media",4.0,3,"Enjoy my summer reading and a regular tablet just will not do. Initially disappointed by the small size, but I quickly learned to appreciate it. Very portable and convenient. I wanted something easy on the eyes with a 3G connection so I did not have to be connected to WIFI to download books. Was a bit more then I wanted to pay but feel I will get good use out of it."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Always happy with these batteries. Cost effective. Last a long time.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",1.0,3,"I'd suggest 8-12 is a good age for this tablet, it's a great starter tablet until your young one shows responsibility, care and proper use of electronics."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great price and solid performer!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Seem to work as well as name brand batteries at a much better price
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This is a very solid device for under $100. The screen quality is great, and performance is hard to beat for most typical use. I needed more power to run some very intense apps, like Litchi for controlling a DJI Mavic. So if you are looking for a Powerhouse you should look for something with a bit more processor and atleast 3Gb Ram."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Ok
0,Electronics,0.0,1,"nice size, very clear but randomly shuts off. cant remove unwanted apps from the home screen. if you watch video..it buffers alot and laggs."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Great buy for the money - these batteries work very well. I've gotten them in the past. The best part is that they are so inexpensive that you can run through them, and not feel like you're running through your bank account!"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Amazing Deal
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Suits my needs.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I bought it for my mom after moving her into an assisted living place. . I was able to use it a little to show mom I was very happy with it. Seems fast and easy to use.i like it better than my phone . :) Didn't get a chance to see how camera was yet.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,good
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I purchased these tablets for my twin boys knowing they are extremely rough the 2 year warranty was a definite plus. i purchased these in February/March I believe and have had 1 replaced. Not due to physical damage but the screen turned white on the center on 1 of them. The only issue I have is when we are not connected to wifi they are only able to access limited items such a puzzles and a few apps. i also noticed that some of them require licensing updates. Which are inconvenient only because it seems to happen when we are not near wifi. Other than that i love them and my boys love them.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,These last about 5 hrs in a roku remote using the headphones. Really disappointed in how long they last.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Best thing I got my kids. They don't ask to borrow mine anymore.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,Great price on a good tablet... especially on Black Friday
0,Electronics,0.0,2,Amazon Tap.. got it on Black Friday sale.. But so far feel not as easy as I think to use.. But if you just use as Bluetooth speaker and sound is good.. Maybe just have to learn how to use it more..
2,Health & Beauty,,1,Half the batteries didn't work!
0,Electronics,0.0,3,the fire hd is great for reading kindle books . Its pretty slow for surfing the web. If your looking for a great kindle this is it. I would not recommend this for surfing the web.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,They're batteries. They work as they should. They should last 5 years: hopefully so.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Ok.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Wife likes it. She uses it when she travels. Does'nt like to carry alot of books.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Very happy with my new tablet. Everything is assessible and easy to find. Great pic quality. My 10 year old loves it and has taken ownership of it which shows how easy it is to use.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Good buy and good quality. Last as long the copper top and you get twice the quantity.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"At first we were completely happy with the Amazon Basics line of batteries. Reasonably priced and what we thought was good quality. Well, after a couple months of use in one of our daughters toys, two out of the three batteries that were in the device burst. This is nothing I have experienced with Duracell or Energizer. Will be switching back to Duracell Procell."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I chose this product from my daughter's this is a great product keeps them from fighting and misbehaving. I think everyone should have one for their child this is a great product to help them learn and really affordable the people at Best Buy were really helpful.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I got this little tablet to carry around with me because it fits in my purse. I like it for what I got it to do - have something to read all the time, but it's REALLY slow. So if you're impatient and don't want to wait for apps to load, don't get this!"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Good price, Easier to order them on here than to remember to buy them at the store."
0,Electronics,2.0,1,"I have to say this was not that great a purchase and we will most likely be taking advantage of it's greatest product feature, which is the ability to return it for a full refund. We wanted a smaller tablet for our kids, well this is smaller in every way, options are limited and we have realized that we are better off just letting the kids use our tablet so we can buy the newest one. This thing may go back to the store as soon as tonight."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"It's 85% as good as an Echo... Great sound, nice and loud, but... But the button. That button!!I would give this 5 stars and buy more of them, IF it was always listening while plugged in. Other than that, it does everything an Echo does, it's smaller, and (due to the battery) portable. I like it - I do. But it's not as useful as the Echo in the situation I use it the most."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Got this at a great price as a second tablet. The battery life is so good that I use when traveling for movie watching. Great screen and quick response times.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I bought 2 of these. I didn't want to pay the price for an iPad since they were a gift for my pre-teens. Very satisfied with my purchase and the kids were able to get their gaming apps. Con: they take a while to charge, that's why I'm giving it 4 stars."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Good for reading white and blackScreen is still small
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Really good tablet. Very nice picture. Really easy to use.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,We already had a tablet for our son and it was time to get one for our daughter. They are a good learning tool.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"These batteries seemed to die very quickly. We used them for xbox one and wii controllers and while I wasn't the only person to use them, nor was I always around when they were being used to gauge the amount of their use, I seemed to have to replace batteries weekly."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"I've stopped buying regular batteries (AA, AAA, etc...) anywhere but Amazon.For the price, these are unbeatable for standard alkaline batteries.Especially with toddler toys....batteries come and go, fast."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"I don't know if I got a bad batch, but I'm getting less than two week's of use when I use them in my Baldwin Keyless Deadbolt (https://www.amazon.com/Baldwin-8252-AC1-Cylinder-Electronic-Deadbolt/dp/B00441UCY0/) which takes 4 AA batteries. The Duracell Alkaline usually last 2-3 months, so I'm pretty appalled at how short these. I'm in San Francisco and it doesn't get that cold so I don't think that's the problem.I've tested the batteries with my tester (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005G7SBY4) and it indicates they are good and in the green, yet won't drive the deadbolt.When I took the weakened batteries out of the deadbolt (that still show green) and put them in my headlamp (https://www.amazon.com/Fenix-HL23-Headlamp-XP-G2-FENIX-HL23-XP-G2-GOLD/dp/B00SH08UXY/), they only give about 20 minutes before they completely die."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,As if Amazon had to be any better at anything else. These batteries are great. I was skeptical but you can't beat the price and they last a long time. Must have if you have kids and their toys that require a lot of batteries.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Good Deal, quick shipping"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Like most people I use tons of batteries. The super high price and hassle of the marketing and nomenclature of buying them at the store is removed by buying these Amazon battery packs. More and more I am realizing that when possible it's a good idea to go with the 'Amazon Basics' products (especially for items like batteries). Certainly there are premium batteries that I have trusted for years and will continue to purchase. But I have found no difference between these Amazon batteries and my favorite other brands. So instead of buying 2 or 5 packs of batteries while waiting to check out in the store think about getting a realistic quantity of excellent batteries for half the price (maybe not half, but certainly less than name brands)."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"A great Christmas gift, the kids love the gifts..."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Ok
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Tried these for the first time last night. Played indoor with my wife and 12 and 6 year old daughters. Awesome time! Beats sitting around the table playing a board game. I will check back in the Spring to see if they are still working. So far, I highly recommend."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Speakers has an excellent quality, despite the small size.The only disadvantage is the Amazon Echo feature, not present in this one, which you can just ""call"" Alexa and she will answer you. In this one, as the name says, you need to ""tap"" the button to wake Alexa up."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,These batteries are actually falling apart before we use them. They are junk

2,Health & Beauty,,3,Good deal and they last a decent amount of time.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,So far the batch is worth it. The batteries are solid and work well. When they are on sale they are worth the buy.I recommend and would buy again.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,We did get this when it was in sale for about 50$ and for that this is an incredible value tablet perfect for anyone who wants a screen without paying premium prices. Build quality is fine and screen isn't the best but definitely usable.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Been happy with Amazon batteries. Dont' see much difference vs the duracell that I usually buy. So now, i just the the amazon. This is the 3rd set that I have bought. They are so cheap that I give them with gifts. The parents and kids love me because they usually don't' have batteries."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I like the closed ecosystem, your kids don't see what they shouldn't, what i didn't like my daughter made a purchase by mistake on day 2, turnoff the the one click buying. also i don't like that its set up like its the parents device with the child using it, so there are two steps to logging in. also i don't like the lack of google apps, the device itself itself has a great screen and weight, the bumper is tough and easy to clean, and overall i would recommend it for a 4yo."
0,Electronics,0.0,0,"I'm sure its a great product but there was something wrong with the one I ordered on target.com. My daughter opened it on Christmas morning and was so excited. We went to charge it and it wouldn't turn on. We tried holding the power button down for 40 seconds like the amazon website suggests, nothing, we left it charging for hours and still nothing. Very disappointed."

2,Health & Beauty,,0,"The batteries I got have very little charge left in them. 2 batteries only lasted 2 days in my Wii remote, whereas other batteries lasted weeks. V"
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"I have not had them long but they seem to be doing the job that is required. I will check back in later to discuss battery life if I remember. I will say, that I could have found batteries a bit cheaper around town and on the internet so I probably will not buy these again for this reason."
0,Electronics,0.0,1,"I should have done some research before buying the Tap. I would have rather had the upgraded version that is voice activated. Also, I thought it would be more like Siri where you can ask anything. Alexa's answer to most questions is, ""I don't understand the question."" The Bluetooth speaker works fine."

2,Health & Beauty,,3,They're batteries.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,My family goes through a lot of AA and AAA batteries. I've been buying bulk packs of AmazonBasics Performance Alkaline Batteries for a few years now and my household expenditures on batteries have gone down by nearly half. I don't see any difference in the overall performance or life of these batteries when compared to Duracell or EverReady alkaline batteries and they cost quite a bit less.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"At the price it is almost an impulse buy. I wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies, read, etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy. If you are used to an iPad, the Fire HD is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less. It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn't an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you. Let's just say, after my trip I purchased an iPad Pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children. If you have Amazon Prime, you do get some nice perks that make this a really nice item."

Unfortunately, she was not happy with it as the tablet is slightly smaller screen wise (the next step is 10"" which is way too big, and has 4 less hours of battery life) and I was disappointed despite it being a newer tablet it was not able to decode HEVC, like the Fire TV 2015 boxes we have connected to our televisions. This unfortunately is a show stopper, as we can't view the movie library we have on this tablet. We will wait until a newer version comes out that is improved."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I got it on a offer. For the price I paid, I'm not complaining. It does its work, not the fastest but it should do it."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Work great great price.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"Of the 6 I used so far, out of the box and wrapper, completely dead... thanks..."
0,Electronics,2.0,3,Would have gotten 5 stars but the screen is to light when put on dark screen for reading. All the adds make it feel cluttered but that might just be me. Over all for price it is a nice ereader.
0,Electronics,1.0,3,"Upgraded from a paperwhite and the build quality of this unit is much, much better! Just it's kind of expensive for an e-reader."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Its an alright tablet but I wish you could download more apps.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,good price
2,Health & Beauty,,4,I like this AmazonBasics. Got household items for less. Love it
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"These do not last long. I will stick to Kirkland or Duracell from now on. I usually change my mouse battery once a year, and since I started using these, it is every other month. Disappointing."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,These work just as well as any other brand and here I am several months later with a nice stock of batteries. The price/value of this pack cannot be beat.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Purchased 4 of these tablets as Xmas gifts and the interface is perfect.What a great deal for $50 8gig version.Wife was so intrigued by Alexa voice,now she wants one.The best tablet deal I ever purchased."

0,Electronics,0.0,0,This is not like other android tablets in a bad way.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,It's good for small children. They cannot get to setting too easily
2,Health & Beauty,,3,These batteries seem to hold up as well as any other batteries I've used and they are cheaper than the name brand batteries I had been using.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,very good
2,Health & Beauty,,4,last a long time
0,Electronics,1.0,2,"This is the 2nd one I have bought. The first one went out before the 1 year. I contacted Amazon and the warranty for these was only 90 days. It is a good tablet for kids, but if you are looking for something long term. I would spend the extra $$ for at least something that has a 1 year limited warranty."
0,Electronics,2.0,3,Bought for my mom as a gift. She's not tech savvy but it's easy for her to get used to. Definitely a good tablet for beginners.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"They don't last as Duracell or Energizer. For the price, it's a good buy."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,A great inexpensive rout for your AA needs! Just as good as the expensive name brand batteries!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great deal!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great price for that many battery's they last along time
0,Electronics,0.0,1,"Maybe I had higher expectationin general i will not recommend since the service of Amazon solving situations is not as good as in other products, I've had so much troubles with the amazon free time, I am even not longer using it (it was one of the ""big"" features on the advertisment. I will recommend to look for other alternatives before to take a decision on buying this product"

2,Health & Beauty,,4,good deal
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,"This is an awesome tablet for kids. Love the versatility. This is our 2nd since our older son loved his, we felt his younger brother needed one too. The charger is horrible though. Does not charge well at all. Returned the first kindle thinking it was the tablet. After the second had problems charging, I tried my husbands galaxy charger and it fits perfectly. Then we bought this one. Same problem. The charger that comes with the kindle simply does not fit well and give it a good charge. All 3 tablets had the same issue. I have also spoke to other parents who have experienced the same issue. So in summary, the tablet is aweosme. The charger is awful."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Fair price. EZ open package (thanks Amazon). seem to last. Why pay more
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great basic alkaline batteries at a terrific price.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Easy decision, the amazon basics line of products has always worked well for me, and amazon customer service on their stuff is amazing if you need it.There is little difference in Alkaline batteries. (Costco hits top rank in consumer reports, but I have not seen their amazon battery rating.)But ordering from amazon is so easy, and the quality is good"
2,Health & Beauty,,2,IT'S A BATTERY
2,Health & Beauty,,0,These batteries are terrible. All of my clocks (bought in this same order) need new batteries already because they are all dying. I now have to buy all Energizer batteries. :-(
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"They don't last as long as the major brands, but for the price you can't beat it."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,I was searching for rechargeable batteries and these came up. I did think it was a great price for rechargeable batteries so I bought two packs. Didn't realize they were regular batteries until they arrived. I was a little annoyed. I blame Amazon for showing me these when I was looking for something else.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"in my eyes, they die to quickly"
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,It's good for small children. They cannot get to setting too easily

2,Health & Beauty,,4,just as adverised - fast shipping
2,Health & Beauty,,4,great
2,Health & Beauty,,1,These don't last like good batteries. But are a great price. If you have kids that leave toys on and run out batteries then these are good. I don't use them in the remote or anything I want to rely on for long term use.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"There's different things my daughter can do,on it, plus I can read on it as well."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I just wish it was a little less easy for a toddler to get out of apps. They'll be on a game or show and accidentally...or purposly tap around out of curiosity and it closes the app. It needs less sensitivity but is it is still a great tablet for toddlers and up. The first one broke and I couldn't tell you how it happened. I think I had two of press down on it or something because I had it next to me trying to download apps then turned around in the whole screen was completely cracked up like someone hit it with a hammer. Since then I haven't had any issue with the new one
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Easy to follow directions allowed her to set it up with me watching over her shoulder.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,For most applications they seem to do a decent job. Have used them for about 3 years.

2,Health & Beauty,,0,"These batteries are HORRIBLE. I purchased the 36 pack of AAA's a few months ago, and just started using them last week. So far out of 5 batteries used 2 were DOA, 2 lasted 4 days and 1 got so hot the plastic around the end is burnt."
2,Health & Beauty,,1,Only 3 worked out of the entire pack.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I like this Kindle the only this is it does not read the books as good as my older Amazon Kindle Fire.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Not sure I will be buying these again. The first four pack I opened was dead. The second pack worked but only lasted half the time a name brand battery lasts. I am using more batteries for the same amount of use in my headset. I won't be buying these again.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,exactly as described
2,Health & Beauty,,4,great value and the batteries last just as long if not longer than name brands.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Wife likes it. She uses it when she travels. Does'nt like to carry alot of books.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,"no problems,arrived quickly"
2,Health & Beauty,,0,I ordered a ton of these for holiday candle lights. They are in for 6 hours each night and turn off on a timer. We are 15 days in and every single candle (34 of them) is so dim you can barely see them.Expected to get far more life out of these. Do not recommend.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Trash. Only lasted a few hours.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,These work as well as the name brand batteries but with the convenience of delivery!
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Good value
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Great product for the price . Could do away with the adds . But for what you pay they have to make some money somehow . Would give 5 stars if the adds were not on this tablet factory ore loaded .
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This is the second Kid's version of the Fire that I've purchased and I think it's a good deal. Since it's really for my kids to watch Netflix - I was looking for a cheap option. I thought about getting the $50 option, but I would have bought a case and paid to turn off the ads anyway. So adding it up, I feel like I didn't spend much more than I was going to anyway - AND I get the 2 year warranty included. Not bad in my opinion. And it does a fine job with Netflix streaming so far."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This tablet is great and easy to use. Great way to keep the kids entertain.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"I don't notice any difference between these batteries and premium brand name ones They seem to last just as long, and at a great price."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,It's not bad for the novelty of Alexa. Might as well get the echo. Sound it not bad and I'm no audiophile. Might be good when my echo dots come in. Is it worth it? There are better Bluetooth speakers out there.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This is well constructed for kids. My biggest reason I don't like it is it asks for a credit card, for a kids tablet. I suggest you buy a prepaid credit card or a Amazon gift card for game purchases!"

0,Electronics,0.0,3,Very Affordable. I gave this as a gift so I am not sure how well it works.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Good or better than Durcell at much less cost. Made in Indonesia, not China."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,good so far!
2,Health & Beauty,,2,ok
2,Health & Beauty,,4,These seem to last just fine for games and toys. Great value.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I got this because it was a cheap tablet. It does great for watching videos from the tablet and sound is good also. I don't like the amazon ecosystem or app store. I wish they would sell android tablets with their apps on them like they are doing with their phones.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Wanted to travel without my laptop. Found the Fire to be perfect. Used it mainly for checking email and keeping up with Facebook posts of friends. Found the size of screen to be easy to read. Typing a tad uncomfortable until one has some experience using it. Have yet to use as an ereader.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,My 2 year old son loves this tablet. He is very engaged with the educational apps that the tablet has. Its easy to navigate. I would recommend to anyone

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Nice affordable pack of batteries. I provide photos of what the packaging looks like.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Purchased mainly to use travelling so haven't really had the opportunity to give it a fair road test at this point. It was advertised as capable of downloading movies and books so you can watch/read while travelling without burning through your data or being hit with data roaming fees or having to purchase wifi during flights.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I like this Kindle the only this is it does not read the books as good as my older Amazon Kindle Fire.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,I was impressed how well these work and how poorly some of the brand names don't. Glad I got them!
0,Electronics,0.0,1,"It is too heavy for its size! I purchased it to replace a larger Nook, and find that it weighs as much. Screen is attractive but it even with a good signal in public places, hanging on to Wifi is difficult. It is not efficient when downloading (buffering, buffering...) and I am still debating returning it for another tablet."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"I just went to use these for the first time... and they exploded in the remote I put them in! Literally, a loud pop and a black liquid was leaking out into my remote and all over my hands. Needless to say, it scared me to death!"

For the 70-75 dollars, I bought this for it is great and stays on wifi much better than my old tablet. It is small enough to travel with and browses much faster online than what I used to use. The sound quality is not bad.... and I will also give a spoiler that neither style of apple earbuds will work with this. I have some cheap earbuds that will work with the fire."
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Haven't use the batteries at this time and expect 5 star performance.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"For its price, this a great little tablet. It does have limitations on what it can do and what apps are available for use with it which is the only reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars. Hopefully Amazon will allow it to perform better soon."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,The HD8 is a Great tablet. I purchased two for my daughter's. The tablet feels durable to touch. The screen picture is crisp and clear.

2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Can't beat the price. Alkaline is not the best tech - but it is a low cost battery. I'm NOT really okay that Amazon owns the marketplace and also competes against manufacturers like Duracell. They've got the upper hand. Something seems unfair about this situation. Amazon should not be competing with manufacturers - I won't buy these again. Right product wrong maker. Amazon will soon be making everything and shipping it directly in its own boats and aircraft from offshore. Is that good for me Yes, because it saves me money. Is it good for America Not really - it kills jobs. I'm going to pay a little bit more and buy my batteries elsewhere."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"they are batteries.....they work, or they work. I guess they work"
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"Amazon seems to have changed the manufacturer of this battery. I liked it very much the last year, but the new one has a different look, has noticeably lower capacity, and leaks. Batteries usually leak after they die, but these leaked while they were still good... and apparently died because of the leak. All of my devices have battery monitored One day they were good with 50-90 power left, and they died suddenly the next day. The leaks were mostly minor but clearly noticeable from body discoloration.One thing that has not changed from before is the packaging, and it is still bad. They are shrink-wrapped 4 in a package and they are hard to open as there is no cut-out or pull-tab to break the wrap. It is difficult to break open by hand. Twisting the package causes undue stress to the batteries and that may be cause of the leak. I have had to use scissors or knife to cut open the package."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Cheap price but they sure don't last very long. I won't buy the Amazn brand again.
0,"Electronics,Media",0.0,3,"Got me reading again! Love the merlot cover. This one is the smallest of all the kindle products I believe, and that's a big reason I picked. Also the lightest I believe. Battery life is forever.Two negative points are the Amazon logo in the cover, and the fact you can't do inverted text (black background white text).Those 2 points dropped it from 4 to 5 star for me.Still highly recommended."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Bought this for my 5 year old son. He navigates through apps and sites easily. The built in Wifi is helpful for car rides. Parental controls blocks him from buying every download he finds attractive. We're still trying to figure out how to get Alexa to audio respond.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Exactly what I expected. I own three of these already.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,Does not last. Very short life span.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Seem to work fine!
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Very satisfied.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,the fire hd is great for reading kindle books . Its pretty slow for surfing the web. If your looking for a great kindle this is it. I would not recommend this for surfing the web.

2,Health & Beauty,,3,they're good
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This product is OK but is not the best you can get. for a sale item fine. battery life seems to be a little short. Bottom line.....So so
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"AmazonBasics AA Alkaline batteries, are generic alkaline batteries as good as Duracel Rayovac."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,I haven't even used one yet but I suspect they will work. I stocked up on these because I have a lot of stuff that uses AAA's and it is a super price.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,GREAT!!!!!
2,Health & Beauty,,0,these suck! They run out in literally just a few days. I have used several sets of these for my AC thermostat which is battery powered and the thermostat died every few days when using amazon brand batteries. using Duracell or energizer - they last for at least a few mos. I will never buy amazon batteries again. You get what you pay for.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Amazing tablet for the price. Lightning quick, screen quality is great and it has a great feel to it. It's only limitation it's the Amazon app store."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,QUALITY BATTERIES
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Cheap and easy batteries in an easy open package that is also recyclable and good for storage. Perfect for those toys (child and adult toys) that are constantly using batteries. I wish Amazon offered a package with prepaid return postage for recycling. I would pay an extra dollar or something if I could pack them back in the box and ship them back to Amazon for recycling. YOU HEAR THAT AMAZON
0,Electronics,1.0,3,"Great buy after owning the original kindle Fire, it's very versatile and shows the progress made from the original. You can't lose and pair it with Amazon Prime."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I was looking to upgrade from my old Kindle reader and stumbled on the Fire HD which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. Fairly easy to use. I really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. I wish it supported all google play apps and not just Amazon apps but I can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose. But...when I want to read in the middle of the night, getting to the web can be distracting."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Work as well as major brands, as far as I can tell, but for a much better price."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great value on amazon basic batteries.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Not the longest lasting. But good for the price.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I bought this as a first time tablet for my mother. She has really learned to use it freely. The color and size are perfect for her. She uses it mainly to search the internet and check her emails. Great starter. I am going to download some books for her to read as she travels.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Batteries that get the job done. Cool packaging. Amazon claims another industry.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Great device and easy setup.The ease of use for the kids are also great.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,Battery doesn't last the up to 7 hours estimate. Didn't even last 4 hours one day. Watches video mostly but should last longer than that.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Dollar store Sunbeam batteries lasted longer than these crappy things. So disappointing!
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"They are batteries, and low cost. Don't know how long they will last yet. Tell you more on that, when the time comes."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Hi folks... these are just good all around batteries. Used them for years.

2,Health & Beauty,,3,A good value but I'm still using them so don't know how long they will last. To be continued
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"At first I wanted to return this product, I bought it for my 2 yr old. I decided to keep it bc my husband liked it and of course my daughter likes it. I dnt like the fact you cant use the audible app on the kids version. I also bought it so my daughter could be independent, as far as the books none of them are read aloud. She came maneuver the games and movies tho. Its an ok product tho, I love Amazon. My daughter still likes my Samsung Tab better. Would recommend for older kids."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"It works well for me, however, my wife seems to have cold fingers, and the touch screen does not always respond. One other odd quirk. If the tablet is turned off, and you plug it in to charge it, it automatically turns on. You then have to wait until it boots, and then turn it off again. This is very annoying. Before recommending to someone, I would tell them about this annoying quirk."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Nice amount of batteries to have for back up

0,Electronics,1.0,2,"This Kindle was purchased on the black friday sale. At the time I felt it was a steal at that price. The first tablet I purchased a few years ago was the original Kindle Fire, the following year I purchased an iPad mini and now have the iPad mini 4. As you may already know, the iPad does not have explandable memory. This Kindle can have expanded memory to 200GB so that was a good selling point for me. After setting this new Kindle Fire up, I noticed that viewing photos were not as clear as the original iPad mini even without retina display, and the color had a greenish-yellowish tint to it. Some may not notice this if they do not have something else to compare it to. I'm a pro photographer so this was quite unaceptable to me. I was not expecting perfection with the colors but people's skin tones appeared greenish as if they were Vulcans. I also like to read tech manuals and magazines of which many are in PDF format. The Kindle will read this format but the Kindle Fire after all these years still cannot display the cover art from pdf books, etc.; it displays an acrobat pdf document logo instead. If you have a large library of pdfs you have to read through the document titles instead of being able to select by seeing the cover of the book. That was enough for me, I've been spoiled by the ease of use of the iPad and the display with accurate colors. Back to the store for a prompt refund it went. Overall..still a good deal but if you are used to an iPad for the reasons I am..you may be disappointed."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Excellent
2,Health & Beauty,,0,More than half did not work
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"Hoped this Fire HD 8 would be faster than my old HD Fire...not so much, I guess I expected the new Fire HD 8 to perform better but it still lags and is slow to load information while surfing the Internet. My wife's Ipad is light years ahead on this one, but what do you expect from a 60-70 dollar tablet."
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,"We bought this for our 7 year old and at first we had some issues loading things, but things seem to be working great now. He loves it and he can play games and load apps. Just what we wanted it for."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I bought this device to use with children in my therapy practice. It is taking me awhile to figure out how to set it up and organize it. IT 'took over' and set up things with Amazon I did not approve such as charging my account and registering me with Prime before I could figure out the settings. The picture quality for the screen is beautiful but the camera photos are very pixelated.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,I am delighted with my puchase!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Excellent quality
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Great device and deal, specifically for the little ones"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,great product
2,Health & Beauty,,3,solid AAA batteries that last na expected ammount of time. packaging easy and this is a seriously convenient option. Will always use this now as the price point and convenience make any other batteries a less economical choice.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Arrived as advertised and ahead of schedule. Not quite as long lasting as a major name brand but good for the price point.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,I originally wanted to buy Duracell brand batteries but I bought these instead (Aug. 2016) as they were cheaper. I just today had to remove a set of these from a remote thermometer and they had leaked even though the date printed on the batteries was Jan. 2025. My savings on these cheaper batteries was far less than the cost of my now damaged thermometer.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,WORK GREAT
2,Health & Beauty,,1,Not happy with quality. Do not last very long in various devices.My guess is that milliamp hour ratings are very poor/low.I have used many of these batteries in a short time span compared to Duracells.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,This a great tablet for child. I got this for my niece who is about to turn 3 years old. She love the games and the TV shows that was included with the tablet.

Most kids do not understand that clicking on a bunch of pictures will download that game/program, which is CLOG download times. Needs a better way to remove unwanted items, rather than clicking.. and clicking on every item. Speed and performance is pretty good for a tablet. App store is great and has many items."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,I got this because it was a cheap tablet. It does great for watching videos from the tablet and sound is good also. I don't like the amazon ecosystem or app store. I wish they would sell android tablets with their apps on them like they are doing with their phones.

0,Electronics,4.0,0,"I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon's customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company's operations, programming, or software."

1,Electronics,345.0,3,"Like a lot of reviewers here, I struggled to find the right Bluetooth keyboard to go with my Kindle Fire HD. In the end, I decided to go with the Amazon one, figuring that because Amazon made the Fire and the keyboard, there would be fewer potential problems. At first, this was a good theory. I opened the keyboard as soon as it arrived and paired it immediately to my Kindle Fire HD. There were no problems and it worked perfectly.At first.Unfortunately for me, the next time I worked with the keyboard, I was on a plane trip. I decided to get some writing done (I write novels in my free time) and fired up the keyboard and the Fire. But this time, the keyboard wouldn't pair. At all. The Fire SAID the Keyboard could be paired -- it remembered they had been paired before -- but it just wouldn't pair it. I tried everything I could think of, including pressing the connect button on the keyboard several times to re-pair it. In the end, I had to give up. Instead, desperate to use the flight to write, I borrowed my wife's iPhone 4S. Oddly enough, that had NO problem connecting to the keyboard and I was writing in no time (albeit on a smaller screen and in the notes mode).When I arrived on vacation, I was worried I had a lemon on my hands. Sure, the keyboard worked, but not with the Fire, only the iPhone. That wasn't the plan. I noticed that other reviews said that the keyboard worked initially with the Fire and then wouldn't work again. I thought there was a major glitch.I decided to keep messing with it and discovered this problem and solution. If you ONLY pair the keyboard with the Fire, you will have no problems"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Very nice packaging. Good batteries.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,good batteries purchased them based on other's review which help me to buy the batteries.

The only problem I have with this fire and the older version that I also own is the poor selection of apps and games that Amazon offers.

2,Health & Beauty,,0,These don't last long at all.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"The tablet is great and I like the warranty that it comes with, but I don't like the charging port. The wire that comes with the device is too short and will not fully snap into the device. Which will not let you charge the device unless you place it very carefully in the right position and then don't touch it. Had to buy an after market cable with an 8mm plug length to get it to charge. We bought 2 of the tablets and they both did the same thing. On one of the tablets we bought one of the magnetic plugs so that a younger children will not have problems with a loose plug."

0,Electronics,0.0,2,bought this during black friday (actually Thursday). ok for price. but not cool i had to buy extra storage for not a great price.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Second purchase of an amazon battery product and just as disappointing as the first. Batteries don't last very long and they quickly leak battery acid. Installed for less than 1 year and already leaking in two separate devices stored in different conditions. Will never buy amazon batteries again. Definitely not worth the few dollars saved.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,They work.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,I purchased this tablet for my grandmother to use. She loves it. It is easy to navigate for her. The only thing that annoys her is when the apps need to be updated. She does not have internet at home so she has to wait to update her apps when she visits family (who has internet service).
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Terrible!! The batteries drained way too fast. We put them in wreaths with lights and went dead within 2 days. They were timed for 4 hours so it's not on for long. We used Energizer batteries last year and worked for the 20 days that were on display and didn't have to change any. But I guess for 24 for 100 you get what you pay for. Will not buy these again.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good Purchase !
2,Health & Beauty,,0,I came here to look at the one and two star reviews and see that people are saying the same thing I've been thinking since trying to use my first shipment of these batteries which are supposed to be better than the previous version that they replaced. I've used 3 of these batteries so far and each one has barely lasted 2 weeks in my mouse. The previous version usually lasted a couple months at least. It seems like in this day and age it's rare that when things are supposedly improved upon that they're actually better. I can only guess that Amazon found a cheaper supplier for their branded batteries. I guess it's time to cancel my subscribe and save subscription since I'm not the only one who finds these batteries to be subpar to their predecessors. If the rest of the batteries in this pack perform better I'll update my review to reflect that.***Edited to add on 10/12: Now that the 4th battery from this pack lasted just over 2 weeks in my mouse I will be contacting Amazon Customer Service. As I mentioned previously the older version of these batteries worked so well that I have to wonder why they changed them. I see the larger size Amazon batteries still carry the older name.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,I've had these AA Amazon batteries for a month now and I've had no issues. I replaced the batteries in many of my sons toys when I first got them and all of the toys are still going strong.This pack of batteries comes with 48 AA batteries. It comes in a nice box which I'm still using to keep the unused ones in for storage. I think that the value of these are much better than any other brand. At Walmart for a 24 pack of energizer you will pay 9.94 and for a 24 pack of Duracell you will pay 13.97. This comes with double the amount! With a kid I've learned I can spend a fortune on batteries with all the toys that do not include batteries so I will continue to use these. Very happy with them so far!
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Great for reading and Netflix. Fits nice in purse. Good price.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Updating 3 tablets for my kids from fire 7. Kids love them. Can keep them from fighting in a few seconds
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good battery
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I like the tablet; however, there are occasions when it does not boot up when it is turned on. I probably need to take it into the store so that a determination can be made and it can be fixed."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Happy with the purcase. Gift for my mother in law.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"It freezes a lot. Lots of problems getting games to cooperate. But overall, my son loves it."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"These are good batteries, but they don't seem to last as many charges as some other brands I have used. They start to last a shorter time between charges. They were much less expensive than the other batteries so it probably all evens out."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Cant go wrone with affordable batteries.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,These are just as good as any of the popular brand batteries. My new go to brand.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,for the price these are wonderful!
2,Health & Beauty,,0,i like amazon product.but this battery was not good.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,They work great.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Better performance than I expected. I feel like I get just as much out of these as the name brands and the price is fantastic. Highly recommend!
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"My daughter loves that it is pink and she enjoys watching videos/playing on the tablet, which is what really matters. Sufficient and cheaper alternative to the more expensive tablet alternatives."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great deal
2,Electronics,,3,For the price very good value and its lasting well
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Work great.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,they don't last as long but they're cheap

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I bought this for my wife, this is her third Amazon Fire tablet. She mostly uses it for reading but she really likes the speed and the additional features on this one. She's very happy with it"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,These batteries are a no brainer. They work great and the price can't be beat.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Dead on arrival...please stay away.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,They're batteries. They work well. I use them in motion activated night lights.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Works well for browsing and reading. It also has great apps.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,Only slightly cheaper than name-brand and far less than half the capacity.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"Tablet is great. I am trying to get my daughter use to the kindle. We started her at 10 months on an Ipad and thought it would be easier to get one her own tablet now that she is almost 2. Not so, she is struggling to navigate in the kindle. I am not able to transfer her games and movies."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I picked this tablet up for a 5 year old grandchild as a way to learn how to use a tablet works fine .
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,Great for the kids to play with and easy to monitor their time spent on it and the content they can access.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Between LeapPads, Xbox controllers and remotes, we use batteries a lot. These have held up great with a comparable lifespan to other household brands."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,great batteries
0,Electronics,1.0,3,"The amazon fire OS is not a perfect OS but it is very functional and useful for your average tablet use. I would recommend checking the Amazon store to ensure the Apps you are thinking of using on a Fire tablet to ensure you dont have any issues. The size on this one is good, the screen is not the brightest HD screen that is available, but at this price point i cannot complain."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"my son loves it, is on it all the time, loves all the games. always trying to download all things all the time."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"It is a nice little no frills tablet, but it could be better, for one it is only limited to amazons web browser, and I like chrome. It is no big deal because what I paid for it I did not expect it to be blazing fast or anything like that."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,It is good product I will till my friend about it good
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This was purchased to give as a Christmas gift. It's no iPad, of course, but that's not really the idea. It's a strong performer for the money and, in our case, allowed an Amazon Prime member, who didn't have a tablet, to enjoy some entertainment when traveling or hanging around the house for the first time. Made a great gift, he's very pleased."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,they seem to work as well as any other battery I've tried.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,tested these batteries along side name brand in a handheld microphone and they actually preformed better and lasted longer then the big name brands.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good value
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good buy on good batteries
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Its a battery and it works

0,Electronics,0.0,2,"I had fire hdx 8 and loved it, unfortunately got damaged and could not replace. I purchased the fire HD 8 and exchanged n pay difference for fire HD 10. The 8 did not have a lot of options I was used to. :("
0,Electronics,1.0,3,"I grabbed this when it was on sale for Black Friday because it was such a good price. I had a regular Kindle before & traded it in to Amazon with the intention of getting another regular Kindle but I never did. In the meantime I did get an iPad Pro & I thought that would function as my Kindle/e-reader. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love my iPad. But the iPad Pro is just way too big to comfortably read in bed (12.9‚Äù) or carry around in my bag to have with me when I expect to be in a waiting room somewhere & might want a book or magazine. It‚Äôs also too big (and too expensive) to bring to the gym to set on the treadmill to watch a TV show while I workout. So I grabbed this Kindle hoping it would be everything my iPad is not. So far it does everything I need it to do. It was easy to set up right out of the box. I easily synced it with my Amazon account so I could pull my books, music, movies, & TV shows right from my Amazon account right away. I did add the Netflix and Hulu apps so I could watch some shows while I worked out. The screen is great. The picture is crisp and clear & way better than I expected. The sound is fantastic. It is easy to read on (which should be no surprise since that it was Kindles are made to do). I like that it integrates so easily with my Goodreads account. I haven‚Äôt spent much time browsing the web on it since that‚Äôs not what I bought it for. So I can‚Äôt speak to how it functions as a traditional tablet. But as an e-reader and media player, it is fantastic. I have had some issues with the SD card alerting me that it has been removed when it wasn‚Äôt, but some research showed me that it is not an uncommon issue with these Kindles & I‚Äôm hopeful that it will be resolved soon. Overall this is a great little tablet. It‚Äôs small & lightweight enough to just throw in my bag & have with me wherever I go. The size is perfect to read a book, but also a great size to watch a movie on when you‚Äôre on the go. It also feels pretty sturdy. I did buy a case for it, but I feel like it‚Äôs pretty solid on its own."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great deal. They work just as well as any other familiar name brand battery. Long life.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Damn that's a lot of batteries!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,It was so convenient to purchase the batteries along with the device I bought for Christmas that needed the battery. It shipped right along with the gift.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"DO NOT PURCHASE! These batteries leaked in a machine I was using in my kids room to project stars on the ceiling. When I picked the projector up, it leaked battery fluid on me and burned my arms and legs. It could have gotten on my children! The leaking fluid also ruined the projector.The batteries were new, stored at room temp, used at room temp, not recharged, and not exposed to any fluid or abnormal conditions. Disposing in the appropriate manner.ETA: I was VERY happy with Amazon's resolution despite this bad experience. Thanks Amazon... I'll order batteries from you again. Just not your brand..."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"They're batteries, and they're alkaline and they work very well."
0,Electronics,1.0,3,I love this little speaker. It is small enough to carry it wherever I want to bring it yet loud enough to be heard The Alexa interface is pretty cool as well. The only issue for me is that it doesn't connect with Apple Music. This issue is easily resolved by putting Tap in Bluetooth mode and playing Apple Music through my phone to the Tap

0,Electronics,0.0,3,Bought for wife who is not into the techie word. She likes it - suggest buying a protective screen and padded case for it.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I thought it would be good for my 2year old he does awesome on a iPad but could not get the hang of the kindle fire
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Wrong Item
0,"Electronics,Media",16.0,3,"I got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed. cover doesn't have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle."
0,"Office Supplies,Electronics",0.0,3,Nice alternative for reading kindle books for kids. Not many features but good enough for reading.
