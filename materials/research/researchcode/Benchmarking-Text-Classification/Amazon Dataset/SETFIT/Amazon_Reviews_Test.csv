2,Health & Beauty,,3,A lot of battery for the buck.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Great tablet for toddlers. Easy yet fun. I purchased two tablets for my grandkids, ages 2 and 4. They both love it and enjoy playing with it."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,I love Amazon and Amazon products but....MAJOR disappointment. While not much less cost that Duracell or Energizer the Amazon brand batteries were a ripoff! Only lasted a third of the time in the devices I have used the competitor's batteries in before.....bummer :(
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Fast delivery of product as advertised.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Battery life is equivalent to name-brand, mid-range batteries, which makes it quite a bargain. I am often surprised when I change batteries in a high-use device and realize how long these batteries last. They also have a nice look and when you buy a brick of them they are conveniently wrapped in bundles of 4, which makes for easy storage. They wont replace Duracell's in my high-power-drain equipment, but for everything else these are great."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,My sons face lit up the day he saw this and it has been his best friend ever since. I'm so happy we bought this item.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I use this tablet as an e-reader and to listen to prime music at the same time. Great for this.Still leaning other features.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Still going strong
0,Electronics,1.0,3,"Clear screen, buttons act up a little. After numerous days of review I feel that this was the best option."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,My kids have enjoyed using this device. They have downloaded games and shows.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Ordering more. What's that tell you
2,Health & Beauty,,2,its okay
2,Health & Beauty,,4,They work
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Great for watching sports events away from home but within wi fi range.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,These are so far working well in my mouse.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Very durable and keeps my 5yr old entertained. I have to limit his use. Lots of apps/games that incorporate learning. Very age appropriate and safe. No worries on what my child is being exposed to.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"Works well. But does not offer access to the apple or android App Store. Without the apps that I need, this tablet is not as useful."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,My 5 year old loves her Kids Fire Edition Kindle! Very easy for her to use.
0,Electronics,2.0,3,"The amazon fire OS is not a perfect OS but it is very functional and useful for your average tablet use. I would recommend checking the Amazon store to ensure the Apps you are thinking of using on a Fire tablet to ensure you dont have any issues. The size on this one is good, the screen is not the brightest HD screen that is available, but at this price point i cannot complain."
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,2,Needs to be more simpler. parental contorl still need to be better
2,Health & Beauty,,0,These did not last long at all.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This product is very good for little kids to keep some very entertained. Occasionally
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"I mean, it's a crap ton of batteries for a decent price. They just die quickly."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"works great, easy to use. play videos and game good"
0,Electronics,0.0,0,"I have only had this Amazon Fire Hd8 since December 6, 2016 and it has already quit charging."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,These work well.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"These are fair batteries. They are fine for most toys, etc. but they don't seem to last as long as Duracell or Energizer batteries. And I've found some of the packs to be hit or miss. I've had a few packs with several of the batteries already nearly drained straight out of the package."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good price
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Not special or anything new, but hey, quality item with free shipping on Prime. YES PLEASE :)"
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,1,Very difficult to connect to You Tube. Very frustrating
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"I bought these batteries to charge my insulin pump - a life critical device. After I started using them, I found my pump worked terribly and after testing all other variables, popped out the Amazon battery and replaced with a Duracell, and everything was back to normal. I won't use these again."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Compared to last years 7' this is a worthy upgrade. More storage and screen size by default. The OS is much more improved on the new hardware and is actually snappy and responsive. My only gripe is the old type connection that kids love to either try force in upside down or break by bending. They should have moved to usb-c. Other than that, great product for the price"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great bargain.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,E-Reader battery doesn't hold up as long as stated.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,I go through batteries a lot and found these to be very economical
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,Great for the kids. Durable. Nice that you don't have to download any software or block anything. Slow tho!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good value. As good as Duracell
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Not bad for generic
2,Health & Beauty,,1,not long lasting move on pay more get more
2,Health & Beauty,,4,I installed three of these beautiful AAA cells into my bike light. Now I believe that I am less likely to die in a violent crash with a car.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,cheap and work gritty good
2,Health & Beauty,,3,good value
0,Electronics,0.0,1,"Bought this for my toddler to watch his shows on netflix amazon and vudu. Vudu isnt compatable, netflix is so slow it kept buffering, so he got upset. Acording to its specs it has a faster processing system than my linsay tablet bit its five times slower atleast. Downloading anything takes forever. It was also very difficult to navigate.Over all waste of money"
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"You can't beat the price, but I've had some of these batteries just die on me after less than a month of use."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I was using this for a while it was 10X faster then my kindle 5th generation yes 1gb of ram but the App Store made from Amazon is not the best so I downloaded the google play store to get the apps I mostly used I only use my kindle fire had 8 for books and reading or watching YouTube or the web I'm giving the rating 4 stars
2,Health & Beauty,,0,These batteries are actually falling apart before we use them. They are junk
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This tablet works great but the only down fall is often times it slows down. Other than that great tablet for children at a good price.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,It's great but I miss the hd option. My 5yo loves it!
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Great product for my 10 year old son. Very easy for him to find what he wants
2,Health & Beauty,,3,power!
0,Electronics,0.0,2,I wish it has some more of the apps from the play store some are just not there
2,Health & Beauty,,4,great/solid product. last as much as leading brands
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,Bought it as a Christmas present based on input from a friend of mine
2,Health & Beauty,,4,great value
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Pros: a lot of things for kids to do from apps to watching movie and playing games. Cons: like most androids it tends to freeze.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,You can not beat this deal anywhere. These batteries were just as good as the top brand batteries my husband always buys... if you are running through batteries all the time because of kids toys (which was my case) this will be a good deal for you! BUY IT!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Surprisingly handy to have so many batteries around!
0,Electronics,0.0,3,My daughter loves this tablet. She can navigate through the apps with ease.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,My Grandma likes it a lot. For the basic book reader nothing beats it for the money.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,For the price it's a bargain. This is a perfect solution for a reader and simple browsing. I use this at night before bed.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Batteries Didn't Last Long
0,Electronics,0.0,3,My grandson is very happy with his Kindle. The case protects it very well.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,I'll be paying extra for energizers they last longer.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"I'm not entirely pleased with Amazon's batteries. It seems to me that these have been dying faster than the bulk pack I got at Costco long back (which lasted a long time!). I don't think I'll get these again, I'm returning to the name brands at Costoco once these are used up (and they are getting used up at a rapid pace)."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"The only thing that I don't like about it is that the screen is not made to be seen in the sunlight. If I wanted to take it to the beach or poolside to read, I would not be able to see it in the sunlight. Otherwise it is terrific!"
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Amazon continues to offer quality products with the Amazon fire HD 8 for a reasonable price.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I bought this for my dad in his late 60s mainly to listen to music and read ebooks borrowed from the library. I set it up for him and he loves it. I just don't like that it has ads on the start up unless you pay to get rid of them.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Bought as a Mother's Day Gift. This is great for someone who does not already have a tablet, and is a bit uncomfortable with technology. The tablet guides you pretty well, and once we had it setup with OverDrive, the recipient was very happy. FREE LIBRARY KINDLE BOOKS!"
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"As with my review of the other batteries I reviewed, they're batteries. They all work and provide approximately 1.5vdc as supposed to."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,These Amazon batteries seem like a good value.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"These are fine, for the price but not as Duracell"
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",1.0,3,"Its pretty good for the price, my only concern is the quality of the picture, not an hd one, my daughter complain when shes taking pics."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I had an older Kindle but it got a virus. The only thing I have against this one is that it gets very hot. Best Buy did not carry covers for it.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,"This device is a nice starter tablet for kids. The Fire OS with Freetime Unlimited (free for 1 year) is an excellent environment. The warranty is great, and had we kept the device I'm sure we would have had the opportunity to use it. However, the device we received in the ""Kids Edition"" box was not registered as a ""Kids Edition"" with Amazon, thus the FreetimeUnlimited plan only lasted 30 days and the ""Kids Edition"" warranty did not apply. Amazon could not register the Fire as a ""Kids Edition"" so it was returned."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,as expected
2,Health & Beauty,,4,They are batteries. Plain and simple.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,upgraded my 3 year old kindle- same old. doesnt seem that great of a difference. the graphical interface still sucks but its decent for reading.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,This item arrived with no battery pack. There is no way to power the toy without it because you can't just use regular batteries.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Love this tablet. It does everything I need it to.My problem is, I have family that falls in love with it so I give mine away. If this wasn't good, I wouldn't be on my 3rd one.The only thing I would change is the silly ads and even worse browser. Other than that, a solid product!"
2,Health & Beauty,,1,they dont last as long as the higher end rechargeable do or the regular batts do. I would say about half the time.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,satisfied
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I was literally still using my first gen Kindle Fire and finally upgraded. I love the new one. The only negative is the speakers. My first one is louder than this one.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Bought this for my 7 year old so he could play games on those looooooong hockey game car rides -- this tablet was more than enough for what we needed and the app selection is good in the Amazon store! No complaints here!
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Good
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Seem to work fine
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,Love the idea of it. Not as easy to put the DVD movies on it .
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Christmas gift so it's to early to tell, arrived on time"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good product at great price!!
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I bought this tablet mostly for watching movies. I downloaded movies from Netflix and watch them during indoor bike training at the gym. I love the ability to expand the memory with a microSD card, which iPads do not. It's pretty fast and has all the features I need. I read kindle books with it as well. The drawback is that some apps are not compatible with this device. The iPad is definitely more powerful and compatible with many apps I use, but this is a great tablet for most of my current interests."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Seem to last. Can't beat price point.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"Nice bag, however did not come with the shoulder strap, which is one of the main reasons I wanted this particular model."
2,Health & Beauty,,2,It is ok
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Like
2,Health & Beauty,,4,5 Stars
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This tablet is great for kids. I love all the different kids content available. The only negative thing I have noticed so far is that at time it will freeze up and I end up having to reboot to fix it. So far, that's the only issue."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Bought for our 6 year old. Great parental controls allow you to keep track and monitor use. Would recommend for others to get for their children
2,Health & Beauty,,4,A friend advised me to buy my batteries from Amazon. Her family swears by them. I am now using them and agree they are a good buy for the money and I am not worried about running out of batteries or running out to have to buy them.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This is your basic Amazon taplet. Nothing too special about it.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,good batteries for the price
0,Electronics,,1,"I really liked the idea of having a device I could talk to out of nowhere that would answer (although our cells phones can do similarly, but you have to turn them on and press buttons, etc.). It is also gratifying to be able to tell a device to play music and it does.I was quite disappointed in the ability of Alexa to answer any serious questions. Jeff needs to pay to send his programmers back to search school. So many times Alexa says a phrase similar to I don't understand the questionSo basically I paid for a radio. I paid extra for the larger one, but the output is still no different than a clock radio.Come on Amazon!!!"
2,Health & Beauty,,1,they seem to wear out really fast
2,Health & Beauty,,4,SO FAR SO GOOD!
2,Health & Beauty,,1,The batteries go dead very quickly
2,Health & Beauty,,1,Charge doesnt last
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Price was very good and I received the order in one day.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Very durable for a child. Offers more than one user so everyone can read their favorite books.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,PURCHASED THIS WITH A STORE CREDIT AND LIKE IT A LOT. COMPARES WELL WITH MORE EXPENSIVE TABLETS..RECOMMENDED
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good batteries. All fit in the uxcelPlastic case for AAA batteries...
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Great value, long lasting batteries4"
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Good price on multi pack of Alkaline Batteries.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,so far so good
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Its good for a cheap tablet just for checking a website or playing a game like candy crush
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"The advertisement promises a 4 channel boat. It is not - only one channel. Consequently, kids can't play simultaneously with more than one boat (which was the reason I bought several). Simple false advertising. The main reason I bought this model over others was that it was promised with multiple channels."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"My granddaughter loves this system. It is easy for her to hold, and she loves to play games on it."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Good amount of battery for the price.But they are not as long lasting as Duracell
2,Health & Beauty,,4,good job
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Amazon has consistently delivered quality tablets at the best prices and this is no exception.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Went through these fast at a wedding I shot. Used these in my external flashes. I'm sure it was the power of the lights but man they went quick. Lots of bang for your buck though!
2,Health & Beauty,,0,These batteries don't even work in a Amazon Firestick!
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"Worst batteries for photographers. I'm sure they might be fine for using around the house, but for what I purchased them for (using with my external flash) these are the worst batteries I've ever used.Won't purchase them again.The black ones that are supposed to be better are also horrible for photographers.Household use only."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"These batteries don't last. They might be a good value but for me it's more important to have a battery that lasts longer. Or use these for hiking and rockclimbing and working on my car in the middle the night if I have a flat tire. If you use them like that you want a much better battery like the name brands Duracell, energizer etc. If you just want something that's cheap these batteries are definitely cheap but I bought the 60 count Duracell batteries for .36 each. I think the Amazon ones go for just a bit over .20 each. I think the Duracell's last more than a third longer."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,WORST batteries EVER. I thought there would be no appreciable difference between these and Duracell. I was wrong. Mouse was VERY sluggish and would sometimes stop working with these batteries. Replacing them with another set of these batteries did not help. My husband thought the computer had a virus. Problem SOLVED with Duracell. I will not be purchasing these batteries again. Amazon FAIL.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,My kids love using it. They use it everyday with YouTube videos
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Batteries are what you expect. They work. Price is awesome
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I purchased this tablet for my 3 year old and he loves it. He has learned a lot. Only con is that it takes a long time to charge and doesn't stay charged for long
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Great tablet with a lot of features. Great price too.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This is a great device. I needed something small to read books on. This device is exactly what I was looking for.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,My daughter loves her tablet. I couldn't have made a better purchase.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This is a great tablet for kids. I love that their time on the tablet can be restricted.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,great value for the pricing...black friday special
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great batteries.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Now I have many batteries. No need to press Charges, officer. They know not, WATT they do.Is good batteries."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,poor quality
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Good price
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Works good!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great batteries! Just as good as any other name brand battery as far as I've noticed so far.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,excellent product
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Works like all of the other brand names.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Nice screen, got it at discounted price for my kid, replaced a smaller one he broke. Tip add a child proff cover. The migration executive experience amazing! Picked up from cloud and i was good to go!"
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"I'm not sure if it's coincidence it not but two electronics we've put these batteries in have crapped out within a day of replacing the batteries. When I pulled them out of the remote that completely spazzed out, there was moisture on the batteries. I thought that may have been my fault but then it happened again with a Christmas decoration. I'll probably return them...maybe a faulty batch"
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"They were cheap yes, and it shows. They don't last long at all. You get what you pay for..."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Ok people. Everyone knows how it is when you've run out of double A's. I added these to my subscribesave. They seem to last a fair amount of time (even in the game boy!). Every household needs a good stache of double A's hidden somewhere. The price is vey affordable too. Great buy.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,"Product was purchased for 6 year old. Very excited to use. Had a hard time navigating initially. Battery life not as expected(too short). Short charging chord. Charging port at tablet site, easily worn. Very positional when charging when plugged in. Will stick with Apple products for now."
0,Electronics,0.0,2,I have 3 autistic kids and is great cause they can be rough .
2,Health & Beauty,,3,A+ thanks
0,Electronics,0.0,3,So I think I would have rated 5 stars however when I got my tablet home my 8 year old used it for a total of 2hrs...the next day it had a reboot screen similar to Dos windows. Excellent customer service at store allowed me to exchange next day. No problems with the second one. Great tablet for the price.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,This is a great tablet for young children. Our kids got them for Christmas so we are still trying to figure it all out. I would recommend going ahead and purchasing a sd card bc the storage space ran out very quickly.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,These are great! They work well. A great price too!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Long lasting in a high drain device
0,Electronics,0.0,3,It's alright to browse the Internet and watch videos.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,not so wonderful - I don't think these batteries last any longer than the ones I buy at the dollar stores.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Great tab for my kids. This is the third fire tablet that we have purchased for our kids.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Yup. Batteries.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,This large pack of batteries is a cheap alternative to buying other brand names and are particularly useful for gaming. The battery life is every bit as good as the brand name batteries as well. I use these batteries for frequent gaming to power my controller and headset.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"Mine don't appear to have a charge. I bought them for a plant watering system that takes AAA batteries. I tried three sets of these AAA batteries in the plant watering system, which works fine currently with rechargeable batteries. They alkaline performance batteries don't work.I was hoping to get longer battery life from these performance batteries but they don't work at all."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Some of the batteries were already dead, but not all of them."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I was looking to upgrade from my old Kindle reader and stumbled on the Fire HD which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. Fairly easy to use. I really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. I wish it supported all google play apps and not just Amazon apps but I can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose. But...when I want to read in the middle of the night, getting to the web can be distracting."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,prompt shipping and good value
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"great buy, and they seem to work everything I put them in great!"
2,Health & Beauty,,3,These batteries work as good if not better than store bought Duracell
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"The tablet is good for games like solitaire or other app games, and of course for books. But for internet or other applications, it would not be the top choice. Good buy for the money."
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"Wish it was a bit faster loading and browsing, but functions as you would expect for kid friendly product. I would spend the extra money next time for a tablet designed for adults but had strong parental controls"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Don't waste your coin of the expensive store brands. These work great.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,I got this as a bedroom TV. The picture is great and the sound is good too. Definitely worth it for the money.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"When I first started getting the Amazon basic batteries I really liked them. With recent purchases, they do not seem to last like they had, or maybe a mixed-bag (inconsistent with some lasting better than others). I have not done any tests, but feel some other brands may last longer. However, the price is hard to beat."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,You can't beat the price! Lasts as long if not longer than national brands! This is my second order!
0,Electronics,0.0,3,My wife uses this for playing on line games. She loves it
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great value
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Exelent
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Home screen and videos are confusing.But it works great.Love it.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Excellent price point for my basic requirements. It has all the features I need for comfortable reading of online novels and articles.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,light and compact and a little slow with the apps and images
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Not a bad price but after few times I realize these battery run out very fast. Amazon need to do better with that.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,You can't go wrong for the price!
0,Electronics,0.0,3,You can't beat the price. Great deal for what you're paying.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,all and all its a great table i just wish amazon had more apps for the kids to play
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Fast delivery. So far light up well. Hope that it will last long.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"These are a great price compared to buying brand name batteries at the store. I will definitely have enough AAA batteries to last a lifetime now haha. They have been working well since I got them, and I'll try to give an update on when they start to run out of power. My only complaint is that I wish they didn't package the batteries in the plastic film. I feel like the box was sturdy compact enough as is without the need for extra trash waste."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I have no issues with product. Daughter seems to love it
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"I previously owned the Fire HD 7 and was excited about the HD 8. After getting the HD 8 and using it I started to notice how they were able to cut costs. The screen was not as crisp, the processor was slower and the speakers were not as loud as previous versions. Overall a good buy for the price but if you are expecting the quality that went into previous versions look elsewhere."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Great for little kids the case on it is amazing. My daughter loves it. Only thing I would change is the sound a little louder and screen a little bigger.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,work great
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Its OK. Not much life in the batteries.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"I'm not going to go into a great deal of detail about these batteries. Other reviewers here have done a fantastic job of doing that. Instead, I'm going to talk about the quality of Amazon's Basics line of batteries and whether or not they're worth your money. My son is six years-old and owns a ton of toys that require batteries. I can say, without-a-doubt, that we have tried every brand of battery out there. Time and time again we keep coming back to the AmazonBasics AA Performance batteries. They have a long shelf life, retain their charge, and as far as I can tell they last just as long as any other battery on the market. The biggest difference is in price. Where else are you going to get 48 quality AA batteries for 11 Just buy them! You won't regret it."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,they ok same as others
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Last long
2,Health & Beauty,,4,These seem to last just as long as the name brand ones. Will buy again.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Bought as gift for my granddaughter who is 10. She loves it. Plays games, watches videos and listens to music."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Nice tablet, great price for the product makes a good gift for someone."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Awesome for the price.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Honestly, they are AAA batteries. I had a keyboard that only takes AAA and don't have rechargeable ones. So far, haven't had an issue. Whether or not they last as long as name brand is yet to be seen. But the fact that I bought these already a few months ago and I'm currently typing on said keyboard with the first set I took from package tells me they should last long enough."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This tablet is easy for my 9 y/o to use. I like that I can set goals, time limits on games, and a curfew."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,These batteries are a great price. I need to use them and see how long they last before giving a higher review.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Does a lot more than old tablet.It Hasmore memory.
0,"Office Supplies,Electronics",0.0,3,I love this device! Perfect size for my bad eyesight! Lol! I use it all the time! One down side is the .battery life is not great!
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I believe this' a great item, my sister has 1 and we liked it that's what prompt us to get one"
2,Health & Beauty,,0,All the batteries came dead so I did a return and got new ones. Second order was the same as the first.Update: still have yet to receive refund from second order after several weeks!!!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good value and good quality. i will purchase again.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,This batteries have been disappointing. Use them for holiday decorations and some of the items that used to go for weeks are not requiring batteries every couple of days.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"Do NOT waste your money on these. I bought a box of 48 in November of 2015. It is now March of 2016, and we've used about a third of them. The rest are all dead already. 10-year shelf life!!! ... nowhere close."
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,My son loves this thing. He is always on it. Great learning tool and it keeps him entertained

2,Health & Beauty,,4,love these
2,Health & Beauty,,4,great batteries for the price
2,Health & Beauty,,4,They seem to be a pretty good battery. We'll see how fast they start to leak.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,Everything worked well and a little faster than the 7 inch but a little harder to hold with one hand. Ended up returning and keeping the 7 inch tablet instead as it was better for me. Still a great deal

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Got this tablet for my 3 year old daughter, and subscribed to free time to download all her favorites plus some new apps. The only issue is that some things take a while to install or load and sometimes freezes. Although I think that may be due more to my WiFi and the fact that I have a ton of devices on my network. I only wish that it was 4G or LTE instead of WiFI."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Love these batteries.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"These are, by, far, the worst batteries my family has ever purchased. They have all lasted less than one week and I've only used them in things that see usage a few times per week. None of them have seen more than 10 min total usage before needing replaced and q about a third of them have leaked or corroded worthiness a few days. I've had much better luck with dollar store brands."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"If you are in the Amazon ecosystem, the Fire HD8 is a great choice for an inexpensive tablet. Very responsive, good screen, and so far the battery life has been great. The only drawback of the Fire is the apps are only available from the Amazon App Store, not the Google Play Store. For example, there is no Gmail application to install. But that's not what I use this for... Kindle reading, Netflix viewing, occasional Facebooking and light web browsing are well suited to this device. Can't beat it for $89."

Gar-bage.They really don't work or at the very least don't work most of the time. Even when they do appear to work they only last like 1/4 of the time a normal AA would. Maybe you can justify the pricing for certain situations.Should you use them for led string lights and hope they last a couple months Yep.Portable defribrilator No.RC car Sure.Camera for younger sister's wedding in the Greek Isles Nope.Vibrating nose hair trimmer Ok.Computer battery for your 17 hour flight to Siberia Nyet.Get my drift... sure try them out, and keep trying them, like I have, but don't put any faith in them."

I use a wireless mouse for work, and I've had to replace the battery every 2 weeks, instead of once a year like my old batteries.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Works as well as the name brands.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I use it at home instead of a computer. I gave it four stars instead of five because it seems to lose wifi frequently. However this could be due to house wifi issues. The tablet is fast and easy to use. Love the ease of downloading books.

The screen cracked a month ago and Amazon promptly replaced the device without incident. Great 2 yr replacement plan! Shortly after that, my older son who previously used a Nook finally broke. I decided since younger brother had a Kids Kindle, that we would purchase a second one to replace the Barnes and Nobles Nook. I love the fact that I can control what is on his profile. I love that it uses a micro usb charger and the warranty was the biggest selling feature. My boys are 5 and 7 and they are not very careful sometimes. My son did however get a kindle with a Pink case because it was all that Best Buy had in stock. I wish that cases were cheaper and I would gladly replace it. Best tablet for this age and in this price range.Cons: No google play store, slow sometimes, have to re-download apps frequently when running out of space, lack of popular apps."

2,Health & Beauty,,3,I like it
2,Health & Beauty,,4,nice!
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"These are great for the price! They do tend to die slightly faster than other batteries, but overall they are great for what you pay. I would recommend these to anyone looking for basic batteries. The come in a plastic wrap which is easy to open. The same can't be said about some battery brands."
0,Electronics,2.0,3,"The automatic light adjustment is pretty cool, but I find myself accidentally covering the sensor which really throws it off.I like being able to press the buttons on either side instead of touching the screen.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I have two of these for my kids. Ages 2 and 3. They are great for them to watch cartoons and they are slowly getting into the puzzles, books and games on them. Easy to setup and link to amazon account. Only gave it 4 stars because the one downfall is that these tablets are bit on the slow side when either downloading content or loading up some videos. Kids are less patient than adults you know. Overall, well worth the money."

0,Electronics,1.0,3,The tablet works fine. But speakers are not that great If you want a good cheap tablet that works this is it.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Lasts as long as the name brands for a fraction of the cost. I also like the minimal packaging that is also easy to open.
0,"Electronics,Media",0.0,1,Easy to carry in purse or pocket but doesn't do anything better than the cheapest Kindle reader.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Very easy to use for our seven year old. Will probably upgrade in a year to something with more capabilities and more memory. She had an iPad (lost it) and misses that, but this is the compromise until we see more responsibility in how it's treated. Seems durable thus far."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,Our tablet is fast and works very well. I am pleased with the amount of apps that Amazon offers.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This is a great, easy to use tablet. It's nice because it doesn't have to be ""just a kids tablet."" I can do what I want to do on there as well. The parental controls are great. The case makes it feel pretty durable. The battery lasts a really long time. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because we can't get all of our apps/games on there because they're not available which is pretty disappointing. One real popular one we can't get is YouTube kids. My son loved that. He was pretty bummed about that. Overall we love the tablet, and would definitely recommend it."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,as expected
0,"Office Supplies,Electronics",0.0,3,Although not the greatest tablets on the market when compared to Apple or Samsung products but when you weight in the price it is worth the purchase!

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Just as described and arrived quickly.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I've purchased a number of Kindle Fire products for family over the past several years and continue to use them. Easy to use for even my youngest Grandchildren or my 87 year old Mother-In-Law which they use as a reader and for games. An overall good value.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I have a nexus 9 but it is painstakingly slow so I wanted something that does not lag Everytime I try to use the browser and does not freeze whilst playing games and this gets the job done very well. The battery life is also very good. Highly recommended for casual browsing and games.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Works okay as a tablet and especially to access Amazon.No good as a general tablet as there are no Google apps available, such as Chrome, gmail, etc."
2,Health & Beauty,,2,They don't really last to long. But for the price....
0,"Office Supplies,Electronics",0.0,3,"This Kindle is nice and my wife who is an avid reader likes the screen quality but truthfully does not like being ""pigeon-holed"" by Amazon for every book or story. Having to go through them for nearly everything greatly declines from the ease of use of the various functions. The need to find or put her existing library into Amazon in order to use it on the Kindle is ridiculous and annoying. Once again a another good product being sadly limited due to a monopoly."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,A great price for a large amount of batteries. These last just as long as name brand batteries if not longer!
2,Health & Beauty,,0,I ordered these thinking they were rechargeable (I recognize the error on my part but that is not my complaint here) .. so when I received them and used them I was not surprised that they died VERY quickly. Upon attempting to recharge these I figured out they aren't rechargeable (Once again big duh on my part)..Now I'm seriously surprised that I'm only getting a few hours of use out of them!! like a quarter of the use that a typical battery should offer. Horribly disappointed.. I will go back to the name brand batteries for sure.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,i have bought the AA 48 packs twice now and they are terrible... They don't even last a month...
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"For the price and features offered on the tablet, I wouldn't purchase any other tablet. I enjoy using it and overall find it fairly easy to navigate. Easy internet browser with ""Silk"" and convenient access to all the applications I am interested in."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I bought this as a replacement for an older model Kindle my father wore out. Unfortunately, he cannot remember the email and password for the older model, so I cannot transfer the thousands of books he has to the new Kindle. Always write down that important information somewhere, it will make life a lot easier!"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,They last longer then I thought they would.Seeing how cheap they are.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I wish I could just say it is one of my best investment, I love the fact that now I don't have to drag around several of my favorite books I can now have them all in one convenient place the battery life is great my little girl loves that she can play games on it I think it's great I should have gotten more memory though"
0,Electronics,1.0,3,"The touch page Turner is great, you don't have to finger swipe. Although it does take a little more pressure to use than I like I still think it is a great feature."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Until lately 99 of the AA and AAA batteries I bought were Duracell brand. Its not that Ive found any brand to be that much better or that much worse than another but I tend to stick with what works for me. And for those things that I use disposable batteries in (I try to use rechargeables whenever I can) Duracells seem to work out the best. And they are the brand that the membership store sells so I can get them at a reasonable price whenever Im shopping for supplies.I took a chance on buying Amazon Basics brand for a couple of reasons. One is that Ive had good luck with the Amazon Basics brand I dont think Amazon is going to mess up their reputation selling junk. One strong factor is that these claim to be made in Japan, and Japanese-made batteries from Panasonic, Sony, Maxell and other major name brands have a good reputation. But the 1 reason I tried these is price. They are 10-15 cents less PER BATTERY than what Ive been buying and it doesnt make sense to me to pay more if Im not getting any more.These have an overall feeling and look of being made pretty well. Its easy to spot a cheap no-name battery and these are definitely better. They are bulk packed, which is great, why pay more for fancy packaging on something as mundane as a battery And theyre fresh you know thats going to be true with Amazons immense daily turnover of product. If you are reading the reviews, be aware that Amazon has been making regular upgrades to this battery, so something reviewed a year ago is probably long obsolete by now. The biggest change I understand is the shelf life of the newest formulation is now rated at 10 years. I dont really care, theres no way a box of batteries is going to sit on my shelf for 10 years but it does mean that when I get to the 48th battery out of a package of 48 it probably will be nearly as fresh as the first one in the pack.I havent been able to see any downsides, and I do like saving money that would be wasted for fancy packaging and expensive advertising, so unless something drastically changes I believe these will now be my brand of choice."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This Kindle does what I need it to do. The camera could be better but overall I am pretty happy with my purchase.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,I've used 4 of these batteries now and the life appears to be comparable with that of Duracell/Energizer. The cost savings over the mainstream brands makes these a real winner! Would buy again.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Great deal on batteries, however they tend to burn out pretty quick (compared to like a duracell). Price is still worth it!"

2,Health & Beauty,,0,Batteries leaked when in charging station.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,The price was right but they just don't last as long as the other name brand batteries so it's not worth it.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Great product,"
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"So far we are very much enjoying the product. Great for outdoor use by the pool due to its portability. We have not had a chance to really test how long it can go without a charge but a couple hours has been no problem. Only catch is that you cannot stream a single Spotify account on more than one device at the same time, so if you find yourself purchasing the Dot or Echo you will not be able to stream using the same account at the same time."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This is an upgrade for my wife as her old kindle wouldn't charge anymore. She likes the feel and the games plus reading material. It rolled over most of her games easily tried to get her to buy an iPad but she has all she needs on thus device
2,Health & Beauty,,2,I like that these batteries are cheaper but they don't last as long as I'd like. We will continue to buy them though because of the price.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good price!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,no problems
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Great batteries for the price. I've bought other generic off brand batteries before, even some from well know companies like Sony and Kodak (yes, they make AA's), and these do better than those."
0,Electronics,4.0,0,I bought a Kindle Fire 16GB for my 6 year old son in June. After 4 months the charging port came loose and the device will not charge. Best Buy is aware of the issue and will do nothing about it. Amazon will not warranty their product for more than 90 days and they said the charging ports often break if children are using them! They have no options to fix the device and only offer a small discount if I buy a new one. Amazon does not stand behind this product. They are aware of the defect and continue to sell these.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great! Thank you!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,great price for batteries to use in my remotes
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"These batteries are a great buy, pretty much can't be beat for the price to quality ratio. I marked off one star because I don't believe they have lasted as long as the Energizer batteries I used previously, but it is not a big difference. I have been using these primarily to power a head lamp with band that I wear at work at night time out in the field. They provide the same brightness as the energizers but my light seemed to start getting dimmer a little sooner than with the energizers. There is not a big enough difference however to justify the price of energizers, therefore I will continue to purchase the AmazonBasics batteries for sure."

If you're looking for a good, basic tablet, this is a nice option."

2,Health & Beauty,,3,Batteries have a decent life but you are getting what you are paying for.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I previously owned a Samsung Tab3. As a media device (for reading, viewing, listening, playing), the HD8 is fine, even a step up in screen size, clarity, and ease of navigation. However, the proprietary nature of Amazon's apps basically eliminates (for me) using it for work (e-mail, document & spreadsheet storage/retrieval/editing). Since I didn't buy it for its work capabilities, that's fine, but I think that would be annoying to a specific segment of potential users. At some point I will probably spring for a more-expensive updated Samsung tablet (or Windows Surface, if I'm feeling reckless), and the HD8 will probably be passed on to my 9-year-old."

2,Health & Beauty,,3,"When I ran out of AA batteries, I of course came to Amazon to purchase more. As I am on a tight budget, I decided to go with the AmazonBasics brand. When they arrived, I immediately replaced the batteries in my Xbox controller. I noticed that the batteries did not last as long as the more popular name brands.

2,Health & Beauty,,1,"I have found that a large percentage of these batteries only last about half as long as Duracell. I had assumed that since Amazon doesn't own a battery factory, that these are simply a major brand that is private labeled. So I assumed they would last just as long. My TV remote came with a Sony battery, it lasted a year. I replaced it with one of these and it only lasted 5 months."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,Ticks all the boxes I was looking for at a price I was happy to pay. One caveat that I (or the Best Buy and Geek Squad crews) was unaware of: there is a glitch in the keyboard that prevents it from working properly. Kindle/Amazon are aware of the glitch and will download a third-party keyboard fix to replace the keyboard that's built in to the unit until they are able to fix the problem. I made Geek Squad aware of it and they should know about it now.

2,Health & Beauty,,2,"These Amazon brand batteries don't seem to last quite as long as the top brands do. They're not bad, but they don't seem to have the long-lasting quality. For the price they're okay, but I think I'll stick with top brands in the future. We go through a lot of the AA variety batteries and even more of these. Again, not bad but..."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Worth the money. Used these batteries while camping for two weeks and they are still working great. They will probably be used at home or used again next year during our camping adventure.

All the dying batteries are the lame Amazon basics. Bought duracells at Costco. They probably last twice as long. I bought these to get free shipping on orders over 35. Don't do the same.

2,Health & Beauty,,0,"Used it for a mouse - works OK. I have a battery powered egg beater and when I put these batteries, the beater did not perform at full speed. I had some Duracell batteries which I used and it was back to life!!So, I guess these are low powered, Very disappointed"
2,Health & Beauty,,0,they are terrible
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,I just wish it was a little less easy for a toddler to get out of apps. They'll be on a game or show and accidentally...or purposly tap around out of curiosity and it closes the app. It needs less sensitivity but is it is still a great tablet for toddlers and up. The first one broke and I couldn't tell you how it happened. I think I had two of press down on it or something because I had it next to me trying to download apps then turned around in the whole screen was completely cracked up like someone hit it with a hammer. Since then I haven't had any issue with the new one
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"These are odd. Several times so far I have put them into some device and the circuit does not work so it seems dead. Tested the batteries with a tester and they read 1.6 volts, so they are fully charged. Put in energizers, duracells, that show 1.58 volts and the device works perfectly. Tried one of each brand and got mixed results. Good price but Ray o Vacs are about the same and no problem. I don't know what is wrong but for now, I don't like them."
0,"Office Supplies,Electronics",0.0,2,This device is good for entry level reader only in daylight.Its doesnot support reading in dark. To read in dark you will have to purchase a light or cover case with light attached. I either case it will put a lot of strain in your eyes.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Greatf bargain.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"Decent little tablet if you are not a game player. Tablet shuts down and I cant get it back on when I play games for long periods of time. It's not my ipad, that's for sure."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Good products. I like the Amazon batteries. The only reason they didn't get 4 stars is because you can't really use them in products that have a higher voltage demand. As the battery ages, it gets weaker. It lasts about as long as a normal Duracell or Energizer, but the output drops significantly as the product ages. They are great for remote controls, smoke detectors, etc. Not advisable for anything with moving parts or motors."

2,Health & Beauty,,2,These are OK for the price. I have an LED string of dewdrop lights I bought from Amazon and these batteries will last for 3-4 days of it on 24/7 but the Costco Kirkland brand batteries will last 2 weeks being lit 24/7.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great and good price!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,great batteries
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Good solid batteries at a good price. They dont last as long as the full retail name brands which means you do need to change them more often but overall still a money saver in the long run.
0,Electronics,0.0,0,"This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don't like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won't use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it."
2,Health & Beauty,,2,they work
2,Health & Beauty,,4,great price for good batteries. work as well as the name brands.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Works just as well as every other brand of battery with a better price. Powers all of my sons toys for months at a time.

So far I don't have problem with it as well as the other 2 tablets that I bought together with the first tablet."
2,Health & Beauty,,1,died quick

2,Health & Beauty,,4,everything ok
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This tablet has been great for my three year old. Only complaint is that you can't turn off the app download function on free time or see a complete list of what has been downloaded.
0,Electronics,2.0,3,"After much resistance | broke down and purchased my Kindle Fire, just prior to a trip. I read three books during my free time. With limited packing space I would only have been able to carry one."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"We normally buy CostCo batteries, so we don't by the Top brand anyway. It's a question of value. If the top brand lasts to a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 where 10 is the best, longest lasting, battery life, and these only last to a 7 or 8 they are a great value anyway because they are 100 batteries for 22. That's just 0.22 per battery. Twenty-Two cents vs about 46 cents for the top brand is a pretty good deal in my book.Okay I might have to change batteries more often which I see is the only downside.Again it's all about value to me. These AmazonBasics AAA batteries are a bargain."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Bought for my 5year old daughter and it is perfect. You can set two profiles one as parent when has control over what apps can be made on your child's, also many free books instant download that is great for learning to read and even chapter books."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This tablet is a great option for a child as the padded case provides excellent drop protection. The Kindleized Android is very limiting though as you cannot stream to a Chromecast and many other things you can do with a regular Android tablet (Play Store). Space is also limited (even on the large version).
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Decent durability and count of 100 keeps my kids not to worry about batteries availability at home
1,Animals & Pet Supplies,,2,The price of the item was very good compared to other cages however the item itself came tilted so now my dog has a tilted dog crate. The tilt to the gates are noticeable but not very drastic. For the price I'll live with it.

2,Health & Beauty,,2,Everything was fine except a few of the batteries brand new out of the pack I purchased a couple weeks prior were corroded with battery acid seeping out.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,I'm not sure these are lasting as long as more well-known brands. Maybe I just got a bad batch. Not sure.

2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Looks like these will be good for lower drain, standby applications, where battery leakage is a concern. I have given up on the Costco brand as they tend to leak in these types of applications. While overall watt-hour density is average, still good for remotes, and common applications. It's hyped about Japanese technology, but not made in Japan."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great value for everyday use

0,Electronics,10.0,3,"I would definitely buy it again, but it does not have the ambient light sensor like the cheaper voyage does to turn the brightness up and down automatically in the dark or sun. For a product of this price, it shouldn't be missing any features. Otherwise it is great, light, and the text refreshes quickly and is crisp."
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"I have had every version of the Kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a Kindle Fire. I replaced the first one I had in 2014 and it was everything I wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat. So...I got this one. First of all I miss Swype. WHY get rid of it? Secondly I cannot put two of my favorite apps (which work on my old one) to work on this but lastly and most importantly: every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code ""shimmering"" in the background and only turning it off and/or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life AND it turns itself off. It seems to happen when I close a program and move to a new one. Aggravating and not what I expect from a product with which I have been happy in the past."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"I purchased these for flashlight, I seem to have to change more frequently"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"They last nearly as long as name brand, but the price is amazing. Never buying other batteries again."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"We got these for our TV remote. We didn't need such a large package, but it was the cheapest option, so we went ahead and purchased the 20 pack. It was great to be able to save money over the name brands, and since it was Amazon brand, we figured they would be good quality (and we were right). It was also awesome to be able to get them in 2 days, since our TV buttons are very hard to use so the shorter time without a remote, the better!Work great. Probably won't run out of AAA anytime soon, but would consider buying other sizes when needed."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"For the price a great value, will never buy another overpriced brand name battery again."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great price.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I got it for my daughter for christmas. She's very happy with it. I'm surprised how easy it is to use. It could have been 5 stars but the camera quality is not that great. But for the price I got it for it's good enough.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"The price is low because Amazon uses their adds to subsidize the price. The actual tablet works well. The biggest negative is that you can only install apps from the Amazon store. There are many Android Apps available in the google store that are not available in the Amazon store.I primarily use the tablet for bible gateway, dish anywhere, play some games, read the newspaper, and Facebook. In the future I want to try to use it with my local library."
2,Health & Beauty,,1,Do not last long.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Plug and play! Easy to use.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I bought 50 of these to use in a school education program. The workers at Best Buy assured me the apps I needed them to run would work fine. Unfortunately I was not aware that Amazon has it's own app store unrelated to Apple and GogglePlay. Make sure whatever apps you want to run are also available on the Amazone app store as not all are. Specifically they block anything related to Goggle. Other than that the tablet is great and is a great price and really nice case.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"Shame on Amazon for putting their trusted name on this garbage! Nothing I put these batteries work properly whether AA, AAA, C or D, not the blood pressure cup won't fill with air before going into Error, motion lights that flicker when these are put in, remotes that work on and off - which all goes away with name brand batteries!"

I used these in a flashlight test and after two hours, the Costco brand still worked fine, but the Amazon Basics were close to dead. I'm very disappointed with this brand and won't buy it again. For short term use, it's fine, but they don't last over time."

2,Health & Beauty,,2,good part is that they give you a lot of them. bad part is they die way too quickly.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great value!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great for the holidays!
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Not bad, not great. They do as their told."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,All the batteries came dead. None of them worked. Don't bother buying these.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Easy and simple for my grandson to use. Has no problem using it.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"High quality. great value, as advertised, trusted company.. Will definitely buy again and tell others.You will be pleased."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"Sorry Amazon, I love you, but these batteries are terrible. They don't last long at all. Reordered before I realized that they peter out in short order. They have failed in every application requiring batteries. Unfortunately, their made in Indonesia. Wasn't putting them in the China slot immediately but have no choice to do so. Applications referred to are, tooth brush, remote controls, motion lights, etc. Purchased, AAA AA with no difference in performance. I enjoyed the idea of being stocked up on quantity, but the quantity doesn't replace quality. Won't be ordering these batteries again. But will be shopping for a superior product.J.MAC"
2,Health & Beauty,,3,I think these batteries last just as long if not longer than the other more expensive brands.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Great cost/cell option. Capacity isn't the best, but works great in low draw devices like remotes, etc."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Great batteries, seem to be long lasting and I like that I can order them through subscribe and save."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,I just wanted to comment that I feel the individual 4-pack packaging is unnecessary. I personally don't have anything that takes four batteries. Several twos and a lot of threes. I'd prefer a box full of loose batteries rather than having to search around for a knife to cut free what I need.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,So far they have worked well. I do not know how to compare them on quality yet.

He loves taking and editing videos, so the front and rear cameras are essential. Its a nice tablet overall, and I'm sure he and I will like it more once it is completely set up the way we want it."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great option for all the little doo-dads and junk that doesn't need much power. I use these in TV remotes and such.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Amazon MayDay functionality is not available and this was unexpected. Other services and functionality as expected
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"Don't last quite as long, but DAMN, you can buy three times as many as leading batteries. For our office staff, very worth it."
0,Electronics,0.0,1,"I got a magenta color because I loved the beautiful purple-ish color shown on the picture. Instead I got a really bright pink-ish color which looks nothing like the color shown here. I went to the store hoping to replace it with a different color but was told that since I bought it on sale, I had to pay the $30 dollar price difference if I wanted to exchange. Unbelievable. The product is good but I never liked the Best buy customer service."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great Quality ...Excellant Price
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Screen is good . Lack of Google play kinda hurts but you will survive. The issue of back buttons or multifunction buttons is that sometime they don't appear when you need them.. as they are part of the screen . So you have to kinda summons them which is a pain
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"I bought this for my daughter. It was bundled with a solid bumper case and has a kid mode interface. She insisted on using her brother's iPad constantly. Not to say there is anything wrong with this product, it just wasn't for her."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great tablet at a bargain price. Purchased at Christmas time for $59. It's an even better value if you have an Amazon Prime account. Only downside is the use of Amazon's Appstore instead of the Google play store which has more variety.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,"this is excellent for kids 3-7. the only thing I don't like is it is difficult to go to kids web pages by typing in an web address once you set up the kids profile, plus it takes away the easy access of the camera which the kids love. I may have set it up wrong as it did not come with printed instructions and I am not tech savvy. This item is extremely durable and great fun for the kids."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Don't seem to last as long as the big name brands, however, for the price you will get more run time per money spent."
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"I bought this as a gift to my parents. The unfortunate part was that I was a little misinformed about the connectivity between the tablet and a chrome cast that I purchases as well as part of the gift. The tablet is not compatible with the table and that was a little disappointing. Other than that, it's an alright product."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Amazon Basics batteries are my go-to favorites. I've tried several different sizes they've all functioned perfectly. We go through a lot of AAA batteries for electronics like trackballs and remote controls these seem to be the most reliable and longest-lasting I've found. Love the price the high quality. A terrifc value. Most highly recommended!--Have a question about these batteries Just leave a comment I'll be happy to help you, if I can."

2,Health & Beauty,,0,"I have never been so disappointed with a product. The battery life is horrible. When used in my camera, I can get maybe five standard-non zoom pictures before the camera shuts down and states the batteries need replaced. When used in tv remotes, the battery life is maybe a week. It is the same with the Amazon AAA batteries too. I will not be repurchasing again."
2,Health & Beauty,,2,I order 3 of them and one of the item is bad quality. Is missing backup spring so I have to put a pcs of aluminum to make the battery work.

For the money this tablet cannot be beat , only minor issue ive noticed is having connection issue with networks at times but this is can be fixed by disconcerting and reconnecting to network.

2,Health & Beauty,,0,"These batteries are the worst of any I've ever bought. They have corroded inside of toys, remotes, noise cancelling range headphones and an expensive gun scope that I own. I've tried AA and AAA, and even gave them multiple chances. The batteries in some electronic devices die within 24hrs. So needless to say, I have switched back to standard Duracell batteries. If you care about life and not having to mess with corrosion, do not buy these batteries!!!"
0,Electronics,0.0,0,It's very tin sounding no bass sounds terrible bought a bose sound link and a amazon dot to hook up to it
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great value for the money
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Having had a problem with Duracell batteries, (most of them destroyed electronic items of mine, even leaking in the original wrapper) I noticed that the cheap Chinese batteries that come with items have given me no problem. I decided why should I pay the price for a name brand and have practically every one start leaking (all before the use by date). So far these batteries have been just fine. I'll continue to use them and check the condition a little more often."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,do a good iob
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"For the price this is a great purchase, but don't expect it to perform like an iPhone or high end mobile device. If you're buying this to play mobile apps it's great with minimal lag."

Well.... no you won't....I have to use batteries in my camera because I'm too cheap to go buy a new camera..so I bought all these batteries (2 big boxes) ....Usually 2 batteries last about 10 hours if I continuously use them, take a lot of pics.(like energizer)......

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Use these frequently
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Hadn't really checked into Kindles/tablets before. Does more than I expected it too, tho now I'm a little disappointed that it's a little limited to Amazon-related and approved stuff. The app store for the device is more limited even tho it uses a form of Android (which means no Flash also). But I'm mostly using it for reading, so I'm happy with it and would recommend it. The 8 was the perfect size for me, the 6 screen was too small for reading comfortably and the 10 was too big as a handheld."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Good Price but a short lifetime. If you use these batteries for any device on a regular basis, you cannot expect them to last very long."
2,Health & Beauty,,2,The life of these batteries is shorter than name brand.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"I used these batteries in a Canon 420 Speedflash. Normally, under multiple exposure (around 3 shots per second), using standard alkaline I'd get 3 continuous flashes before a miss, or with fancy High Discharge Rate Flash batteries (translate - Expensive!), I'd get 5-6 continuous flashes. The last photography shoot, I was asked to get back-to-back images of a person at a surprise Birthday Party. Imagine my surprise when, upon entry of the victim, I captured 9 continuous exposures with perfect flash! I am very impressed!These batteries are high quality and surprisingly powerful!"

2,Health & Beauty,,0,we have had nothing but trouble with these batteries. i have installed them in multiple products and they are barely lasting any time at all. we will not be buying these again. maybe amazon can provide us with a new batch as maybe we just got unlucky with ours.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Batteries are great.....I need them for my work for my camera for taking pictures on the job of properties. Nice to have extras on hand at an affordable price. I don't see that they last any less time than the name brand batteries.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"The Kindle Fire works well and I enjoy reading on it. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it seems silly to restrict people from reading Nook books on it just because it is a different platform. As a book lover, I like supporting bookstores not only the almighty Amazon. Yes, I know there are ways to get around the restriction. The reason to reduce a point is not based on the excellence of this Kindle, but on politics of sharing."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great value
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"When my husband and I bought our Kindle Fire 8, we went to Best Buy and asked questions as best we could. There are programs we apparently need to put create and edit documents and spreadsheets!! We did ask if it had those features and was told yes but I think we need to have a special app. Why isn't there a manual or step by step guide on getting the most use out of Kindle Fire 8. Can I get it online? Kindle Fire 8 fun to use but needs more info for customers. Can we go to a class at Best Buy? Thanks for any help."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"At ninety dollars, the expectionations are low, but this is still a very good table, it's good for light use like watching videos or web browsing, but the camera is a bit lacking, and at certain times the device can freeze or lag.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Awesome
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I purchased this tablet for my 3 year old and he loves it. He has learned a lot. Only con is that it takes a long time to charge and doesn't stay charged for long
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Video quality is very good. Works well with Amazon Prime Video and Music - no surprises there. Apps are VERY disappointing - many common apps are not available - even though there are Android versions! Not bad if you have modest expectations.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"My 14yo daughter loves to read and watch certain shows on Netflix as well as Amazon prime. She is less interested in the apps which is a good thing since you do not have access to google play and all of those apps unless you 'side load' the Google play app which, for the casual person, is more technical that you would like."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Same price to buy all these as it is to buy an 8pack at the store. Why pay more They same to have a similar lifespan. I haven't noticed any difference.When I retire in 30 years I'll probably buy an other case to get me through my last years. But these should last until then.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great deal on batteries.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,arrived fast. Works well.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,seem to be of good quality
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"a good stock pile of batteries for a decent price. do not last as long as the 'name brands' but for the money, they are ok"
2,Health & Beauty,,3,They seem to work well. I have not tried to determine how long they last.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"We buy a lot of batteries and was hoping we had a way to get them to us. Theseas as long as the dollar store batteries. Some items 2 weeks, others 1. I will not buy again."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Between video game controllers, camera's, mp3's, and kids toys we go through batteries pretty quickly. I decided to give these a shot based on the price. I honestly was expecting they would drain quickly and only be good for low drain items like remotes. I'm happy to say I was wrong. They seem to last us just as long as the name brand batteries at a fraction of the cost."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"May have been a fluke, but these lasted not even 10 minutes in two very different devices - a kid's toy and wireless mouse. Will just pay extra next time for brand name batteries."
0,Electronics,0.0,1,Got this for my 9 year old and several games that he wants to play are not accessible on this tablet. Seems like this is geared more towards younger kids. Case is good though and keeps tablet safe. Would be tough to break!!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Because paying 20-40 dollars at Walmart (depending on type) for the same thing makes sense right If you are like me and have 3 kids that all have annoying gizmos and electronic crap that takes batteries it is hard to beat Amazon's bulk batteries.These seem to have the same general capacity of a standard Energizer. I have not tested these with my joule thief to see how long they can last. But I'd say on par with the others.This may sound dorky-- when batteries are this cheap, you will find yourself putting them back into toys, remotes, electronics that you had previously marked as not necessary to be powered."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Good for the price but whatever in quality I guess...don't last too long
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"Batteries are very good, but packaging is horrendous, which is surprising because usually Amazon does a great job with hassle free packaging, but every four bats are packaged in tough plastic. Would have been better to just place the lot of bats in a simple box without the individual plastic wrap. Will not buy again with this packaging."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,decent quality battery strength for price. better than dollar store for sure
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Great price for these alkaline batteries. Being that they are AAA there is not much of a power drain for devices like remote control. I found that the AA amazon basic batteries will not last as long as as you named brand alkaline batteries.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,The only regret I have is that the price went down the week after I purchased it. It is much easier to use than a phone because of it's screen size and it's capabilities.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,Personally I'd say buy the newer 6 inch fire. But you do get more for your money getting the older one.
0,Electronics,2.0,3,"I bought this for my mom while she was in rehab following shoulder surgery. She loved it. I put several books on it for her and she liked the ease of use, she does not get on the computer and so I needed it to be easy."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"great value, why pay for expensive brand when Amazon basic sufficient your basic needs :D"
2,Health & Beauty,,2,These batteries are just a tiny bit too short to work in every AAA device. Beware.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"They're batteries, and they power my stuff"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Batteries for days, easy and cheap. If they simply work, I'll be all good. The packaging is shiny, so they will, right :)"
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Great battery value but they don't last as long. I will order them a couple of more times to see how they work.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,works great for me
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Seem to work great.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Good batteries that work well
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"These aren't the greatest batteries but they work. We've found that they work best in computer accessories like a keyboard or mouse but do not last long in things like toy remote controlled cars. Anything that takes a big drain in short bursts off of them (like electric toy car motors) shortens the life of these batteries fast but things that only use a small amount of energy over a long period of time do a lot better. Some name brand batteries do very well with high drain electronics and last a lot longer than these but if you use these Amazon batteries on low draw electronics you'll get your money's worth.What I've found them good for: Keyboard, mouse, laser pointer, small LED flashlights, small noise making toys (plays music, electronic beeps)Not good for: Anything with an electric motor, toy cars, pencil sharpener, etc...They can be a good value depending on what you use them to power."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,We tried these batteries out but they're trash. They lasted only 2-3 weeks in our tivo remotes which is amazing as we don't watch that much tv.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This tablet is designed primarily to sell, distribute and store media purchased from the Amazon.com product line, ie Kindle e-books, movies viewed or stored from their online movie streaming service, etc., and it does that very well.Reasonably sharp screen, good sound, good battery life and decent component materials. It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store, but must rely on Amazon's own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either Apple's or Google's."
2,Health & Beauty,,1,Disappointed with this product. Used them for led candles and had to wiggle them around to get them to work. At the same time I also purchase ACDelco Batteries because Amazon would only allow the purchase of one box. I'm glad I did because the ACDelco batteries worked great! I would not purchase AmazonBasics batteries again.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,For the price you can't beat these. I have never had any issues with them. They last long and work well.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great value for the price. Seems to last just as long as name brand batteries.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,Great product and lightweight. Battery keeps its charge. Would recommend this product to another young person

2,Health & Beauty,,1,"I've bought a lot of AmazonBasics batteries, and nearly all of them have been more than half dead on arrival. My remote controls won't even work with the brand new batteries in place. I won't be buying these again."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Excellent, thank you"
2,Health & Beauty,,1,These die a lot quicker than typical energizer and duracell batteries
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Batteries came exactly as described. I have only used a couple of them and they work great in the remote..Time will tell about shelf life...

2,Health & Beauty,,4,"I have 2 kids, and they have a lot of battery powered toys. We tried rechargeable batteries, and they didn't hold up like I was hoping. These batteries are more affordable than brands at the store, and I can't tell a difference in performance."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Such a great value. I buy all my batteries from Amazon and only get this brand.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great Product excellent service
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Alot of the batteries were dead or very weak
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This tablet has far exceeded my expectations. The price was way lower than most other tablets but it does everything I need and want.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good deal
2,Health & Beauty,,0,I had to buy a brand new bed after purchasing this item. It kept ripping up and the bugs kept coming from the tears in the case. I do not recommend this for no one.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,I purchased these tablets for my twin boys knowing they are extremely rough the 2 year warranty was a definite plus. i purchased these in February/March I believe and have had 1 replaced. Not due to physical damage but the screen turned white on the center on 1 of them. The only issue I have is when we are not connected to wifi they are only able to access limited items such a puzzles and a few apps. i also noticed that some of them require licensing updates. Which are inconvenient only because it seems to happen when we are not near wifi. Other than that i love them and my boys love them.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Paying $49 for a decent screen size to support portable surfing and email on wifi is a great deal. Not sure I'm a fan of Silk, but it works well enough."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Thank you!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Great batteries, great price!!"
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Was good price.Wish it had Google Play download on to it.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"I bought these several months ago. I use them for Xbox One controllers. Using Duracell batteries I get roughly 20+ hours out of 2 AA.With these Amazon ones, after about 6-7 hours I start getting low battery notices, and unlike the Duracell that I get a few warnings with, I only get one shortly before losing all power. Stick with the name brands, I tried these generic ones and regret it."
0,Electronics,0.0,1,Slow processor equates to slow internet browsing. User I nterface is ok. Really wish it had the capability to lock onto the movie screen while my toddler watches movies. Next time I'll just spend the additional money on an iPad mini for my kids.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,Great Speaker but I really don't need the features. I just need good sound and don't really use anything besides that

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great price! Just began using these batteries so their lasting ability is yet to be determined. DFD
2,Health & Beauty,,3,They could be a bit cheaper for their longevity but they are a good value overall.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Works great/best price
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"great price, works very good"
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"Despite what seems to be a great deal for a 48pack of AA batteries these aren't great. 2 stars only because of the deal as they're for light use. I use them only for my xbox controllers, I understand that the life is different with gaming (sucking up all the energy), but I've put a pair in before and about 2 weeks later had to change them. Not to mention, I have 2 controllers (one has a grip), so I switch between them often. This means they should last longer since I'm not just draining the battery life on one of them. Overall, not great for gaming or heavy use, otherwise they're nice backups. I'll have to compare these to say Duracell, but from past experience I don't remember having to change them so often."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Great price and with a name like Amazon I feel these are going to be good. I bought for my daughter because I gave her something that she needed 27 (yes!) batteries for. Great value and plan on getting again if they work like I think they will. Only a 4 star rating because I don't know how long they'll last. So far so good
0,Electronics,3.0,3,It is a great investment. Can read at night without disturbing partner. Only disadvantage is if you lose your place it is a little difficult to find it. This could be user problem.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,It doesn't seem as though these have a lot of juice. They haven't lasted very long.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Energizer batteries lasted longer than these.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Amazon Batteries! They got me on the price, but how's the performance! Honestly I can't tell cause who's counting I usually by pro cells because Sometimes I'm a pro. Just kidding but really i work in entertainment so we use pro cells but I bought a box of these just to keep handy and save the day when pro cells are not available. These really aren't that bad. Pro TIP: Make sure you dispose them properly so you don't kill the earth. I'd definitely buy these again. Now that I am a father, there's all kinda of other things to put batteries in. Also do not skimp out on your earthquake kit. It sounds like whatever but honestly you need to prepare folks!"
2,Health & Beauty,,4,no complaints
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"Get this for shopping and fun, not for productivity. This is an inexpensive tablet chocked full of bloatware and ads. I got it for the wife and she uses it to play mini games and shop, and that's what it's meant for so mission accomplished.The GOOD: It's cheap. Fairly good battery life. Fairly decent screen. Quick charge time.The BAD: It always has some sort of advertising for amazon shopping - annoying at times. Sound quality is terrible. Made of super slippy material, hard to hold; get a case for this or you will drop it; often. Amazon only apps. No android or IOS apps will work with this. It's kinda slow. No YouTube.Overall: If you need a simple tablet for light web browsing, shopping, music, movies, reading and small games then this will work fine. As a primary productivity tablet, forget it. Get something way more robust than this."
0,Electronics,0.0,2,I do like the Fire Tablet - but I feel that if it is going to have a camera it should have been a better camera. The internet works but I find it takes a while to load. I have read a book on it but - I prefer to use my original paper white - that can be read in any lighting including outside. But for what it is and the price it was - its a good product.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Over all pretty good product.i am not so sure if it's got Bluetooth connectivity. i've had it for a few months now and kids seem to enjoy it a lot.certainly I recommend to anyone who wants to give their kids the ""best ""gift."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I purchased the 8 inch device. Also purchased black cover.I played for it and asked if I could get it set up and was told it would be 40 more dollars. I did not have 40 more dollars so I left the store with my kindle and had someone else set it up for free. I was disappointed I had to get someone else to set up my kindle.
0,Electronics,2.0,2,It has what i wanted click to turn page and that is the only reason i paid that price for it. there is nothing special about it. i thhought that the battery would last longer and as an avid reader it doesn't last long enough.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,We bought this as a replacement. My daughter cracked the screen on her other one right before Christmas. We love it! Only issues we have is something she does will make it so only half the apps/games show. However we like she can only play safe age appropriate games and don't have to worry when she's on it.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,good
2,Health & Beauty,,0,SO BAD DO NOT EVEN LAST TWO MONTHS IN A MOUSE....A MOUSE!!!!!That's what I call utter garbage. Would return if possible.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,A great money saving alternative to the ipad for my son who likes ti play games and read books.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Previously purchased and used these batteries. They last longer than other store brand. Worth the money.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,I bought these batteries to use with a battery operated pump that transfers gas from a gas can into the tank of my riding mower. This is a far better way of fueling my mower than trying to lift a five gallon tank and trying to empty it into the mower tank. The pump uses 4 AA batteries and that is the way the Amazon batteries are packaged. Having them bundled in foursomes is convenient. My pump runs perfectly with these batteries.These batteries are said to have a shelf life of ten years so I won't be having to buy more AA batteries for at least that long. The price of these batteries is a genuine bargain and is it highly recommended to get this offer if AA batteries are needed.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"Good price but quality is not really reliable.Some of them run out power real quick and others last super long.After 6 months storage, already have one pack of the batteries generates white powder type of corrosion (indoor, dry cool place, not used yet). Not sure it is quality control issue or stay in their shelf too long before shipping."

2,Health & Beauty,,0,"Now I know why these are so inexpensive! I'm baffled as to how they've earned such high reviews. I've used them in a variety of devices portable LED lights that I utilize maybe once every two months for events, in a battery-operated soap-dispenser, in tap lights in a closet/hallway, in toys... In the soap-dispenser, they lasted three weeks. I thought the dispenser must be faulty, switched them out. Next set of these batteries lasted a week. In the LED lights, the batteries lasted five hours. Less in the toys and tap lights. At this rate, I'll have used the whole box of 20 batteries in less than 6 months. What a wasteful, useless product!"

2,Health & Beauty,,2,"I like these shoes but Altra needs to pay more attention to sizing. I normally wear US 7.5-8. The first pair of Superior 2.0s I ordered was size 8 and they were way too short. OK, I thought, they run short. I ordered a pair size 8.5 and they were just barely long enough.I ordered a second pair size 8.5 and they are visibly half an inch shorter than the first size 8.5 pair. That isn't running short, it's lack of quality control.I really like these shoes, so I am ordering size 9's. But I do not have any warm feelings about Altra."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Amazon's in house brand of batteries are not bad at all.

Well my Two year old and five year old went tap crazy, like a Kangaroo on a Pogo stick. Needless to say the ran out of room quickly. I tried to teach them to not launch apps that weren't installed but they still have a problem discerning what is installed and what isn't. Aside from this, it is a fantastic device for kids to play and learn with. I especially like the parental control features. I just wish they would put in a feature for controlling what gets installed."

Wanted to get him his own data plan for when we travel longer distances so I attempted to add him to my phone plan. The only problem is the device doesn't have the option to add a sim-card, so my attempt was futile. Its really draining on my phones battery life and data to keep tethering. Soon will be looking in to another tablet/iPad option that allows for the usage of a sim-card some way or another when WiFi isn't available."

2,Health & Beauty,,3,good stuff
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Better price and works as well as Name Brand Batteries .
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"I have used inexpensive dollar store batteries in the past. I became curious about the actual performance data of cheap vs. name brand batteries, and discovered that essentially you pay approximately the same amount per unit of power, regardless of battery (with the exception of lithium ion which cost more per unit of power). Also, I noticed that the cheap batteries did not work as well as name brand with my automatic wine bottle opener. So, if I am going to pay the same amount of unit power per battery, why not get the ones I have to change the leastI was pleasantly surprised to find these amazon basics batteries at a cost per battery that is significantly lower than name brands, but with similar performance characteristics as the name brands. Assuming the marketing information is accurate, these batteries should last a long time, and not cost much. This is an ideal combination in my opinion."

This is not a real negative, it just appeares less crisp than my phone. The increased picture size more than makes up for it in my book."

2,Health & Beauty,,1,These don't seem to last as expected
0,Electronics,4.0,0,"One star because this should've been included when I purchased my Kindles. Bought this second one because I have three paper whites and got tired of playing musical charge chairs. And if Amazon would concentrate on the loyal e-book readers rather than the useless fires and increase memory more than the little bit they did on the latest kindle (I own one) I would be a happy camper. We need the option of adding memory (Amazon invent a chip that only you sell and the only one a kindle can use and I'll purchase). Just give us that option. Fires don't work for just straight up reading (can't read in any kind of light because of the shiny screen). Having to purchase these power adapters separately ticks me off. I don't care about the cloud. I need books downloaded to my devices. We vacation often in our mountain house. Middle of nowhere (which I like). However, no wifi, no Internet access and no cell coverage so cloud is useless. I guess I read too much. Thousands of books. 5,000+ in my library at home before a stroke forced me to Kindle and now thousands more. Include adapters when purchasing devices and increase the storage capacity."

0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,0,"Aside from the fact that the saleman told me that the tablet would be able to get all the same apps that an Android tablet would be able to get from the playstore, which was hilariously wrong, this product would never connect to the internet correctly. I had to reset the internet every single time on the table for my son to use it, starting from day one and up. My son loved having the electric device and I didn't take it back for those reasons, but now 60 days out, the thing doesn't even charge anymore and I'm having to take it back in. At least I bought the warrenty, because this is literally a huge waste of money. I'd rather have spent $500 on a different tablet than this garbage."
2,Health & Beauty,,2,They don't have as much juice as other name brand batteries but they will get the job done.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This is great if you have two kids and want to give them a tablet to play with. My problem is that my child is dyslexic and this is the lowest level reader that currently supports audible.com... that is the hardware supports audible. In order for my child to use audible I had to disable all of the family features and try to turn it into a reader... I was sad because there are lots of great family features that I had to disable.I did not use geek squad, I reached out directly to kindle support. Pre-sales, they could not tell me the difference between the free and paid family packages. I had to get to a senior person to help me figure be out why audible did not work and the to disable the family features ... even then, I could not disable the Alexa app. My child has full access to Alexa and the rights to turn on shopping.... kind of scary.So my disappointment is that Amazon does not make a kid friendly kindle that we can have audible.com on for my child's learning disability."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"They're batteries. They're cheaper than Wal-Mart. What more could you want I don't have stats on whether they last longer than Duracell or Energizer, but at this price I don't think it really matters. The brand Amazon Basics has tons of useful stuff all the way from batteries to laptop bags and more. It seems like Amazon wasn't enough of a household name so they're trying to make it so everything in your house has the Amazon name on it, but I ain't mad let them take over. I just wish they had an Amazon Basics brand for disposable diapers."
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case.

0,Electronics,1.0,3,"As I reviewed different tablets, this tablet kept coming back as my best option for the items I was looking for. It IS a great tablet, but there are a few things I don't really like about it. I didn't realize that Amazon has it's OWN browser SILK. Everything even your banking info goes through Amazon. Not sure I like that. Also, items don't automatically close out when you leave a page and I have to frequently hit the button on the bottom and close out multiple items. It might just be that I am not THAT computer savoy, though I do know how to navigate my way around. Sometimes the touch feature just seems to freeze and won't recognize that I am attempting 'touch'. Lastly, the on/off button is right where you hold the tablet on the side, so I am often 'accidently' shutting it down. Most annoying! Overall, I am happy with my purchase and for the price I like it. Just wanted to point out the other items."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,"Excellent cells for the price range. From what I see, they are as good as Duracells and that is all I ever used to use.The packaging is amazing. Only in China can they still pack in cardboard boxes that surround the package like this.I am not doing any testing, other than use in low powered items like wireless mice, keyboards, wall clocks and the like. That's all I need them for. These cells meet those requirements and that's all I care about. For high volume stuff I use NiMHs, but you just can't beat the price. I am finding that many of the Amazon basics products are a hit. I have bought several things and all have worked just as good or better than the higher priced competition. Good job Amazon."

Nice packaging as well, easy open with no rollers in the drawer where I store them."
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"I put these batteries in 10 of the 12 window candles that I bought - I put my last 2 Duracell in the other 2.

0,Electronics,0.0,0,"The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable."

2,Health & Beauty,,2,"These batteries are only OK. They don't last as long as Duracell and when they die, it's usually instantly. One moment they seem to work fine, the very next moment they are outputting half power. I would say that about half of these batteries just simply died while being used, no warning, no gradual loss of power, simply dead. They also seem to be marginally shorter than brand-name batteries, but to be honest, I haven't measured them. Suffice it to say I've decided that I would rather spend the few extra cents per battery on brand-name batteries. It's simply not worth the savings in my opinion. (I've had similar experience with Dollar Store batteries.)"

As for recommending this to a friend, I would, but would make sure they knew what I use it for."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"I've been impressed with the performance and quality of AmazonBasics battery. Though the price point is pretty low, don't let that fool you - they are every bit as long-lasting and durable as the brand-named batteries on the market. In my opinion, there's no reason to spend more on a battery because of it being a name that you're familiar because I can tell you that my experience has been amazing.

0,Electronics,103.0,3,"I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you."

2,Health & Beauty,,2,"I like AmazonBasics products, so I was excited to see these batteries. To find out if they were a good value, I looked up data online. Bottom line:-- For flashlights, toys, and steady drain devices, you'll be better off buying Rayovac Alkalines here on Amazon.-- For cameras and photo flashes, Duracell Coppertops will be better.Here's why: Rayovacs cost a little bit more per battery, but they hold more energy than these AmazonBasics batteries. As a result, the final price per amount of power is about the same. You just won't have to change batteries as often.Those Rayovacs work best in steady drain devices, but not so well in cameras or flashes. For those high drain devices, Duracell Coppertops hold up better and end up being cheaper.Battery Ninja tested these AmazonBasics AA's in toothbrushes I did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power (mWh), but that they do not carry as much energy as others. The test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others, at least in the toothbrushes. There were no test results vs. digital cameras, photo flashes, or toys, so I'm extrapolating that these will perform like Rayovacs, not like Duracell Coppertops.So, the only data to compare here is the toothbrush test. For energy delivered, these AmazonBasics batteries cost about the same as Rayovac batteries but will die sooner. To say that another way, these batteries cost less, but also deliver less power.Both Rayovac and Amazon Basics are better than Energizer batteries, which appear to consistently give less power and still cost more. I guess the money goes to the Energizer Bunny.Duracell Coppertops will last longer in flashlights, toys, and toothbrushes, but cost a little bit more per unit of power (mWh). On the other hand, they hold up better in cameras and similar electronics. They're probably the best all around battery. So, if you don't like changing batteries and a willing to spend a tiny bit more, Coppertops are a good way to go.Finally, the best value battery is interesting: it is the Costco Kirkland Signature. Battery Ninja's results show that and so do the tests from Consumer Reports. You can buy those Costco batteries here on Amazon, but the price is higher than you'd get at the club. Of course, I'm not a Costco member, so it doesn't matter to me... but buying them here on Amazon is not a good value."
0,"Office Supplies,Electronics",0.0,2,"I love having real books, but these are great for travel and keeping your bookshelves lighter. I wish you could buy them with larger storage without having to buy the larger size pad. It also sucks that they are 4gig, but 1gig is taken up by the OS and advertising. Seriously? It reads PDFs and needs a 1 gig OS. Lame. The last thing I would change is being able to reverse the lettering so at night you could have white lettering and a black background, so it's less bright on the eyes."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,Absolute junk! My devices run only 3 - 5 days with these batteries and probably half have been dead when I put them in my devices. Save your money buy Duracell batteries from Groupon they will stand behind less than quality batteries but Amazon will not once you buy Amazon batteries as has become the case with most of Amazon you are on your on without a paddle.Amazon did send me replacement batteries however they are the same as the original ones. I don't know how anyone can give a positive review just terrible.
0,Electronics,1.0,3,I have not explored all the features of the kindle fire tablet yet. Why does the sound always have to be reset each time? I want it to stay on full sound maximum loudness always.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,I started buying these large packs of Amazon batteries because of the great value and previous experience with Amazon Basic products. These batteries seem to work as well as my Energizers and Duracells at a fraction of the cost. I will be buying more AA and AAA when I run low. That should take a while with this large pack.

2,Health & Beauty,,2,"These batteries work great but they don't last as long as name brand batteries but that's ok. We mostly bought them for my toddler's toys and they work well enough for that!-As a wife and as a mom of 3 kids, I spend a lot of time shopping for deals on the best products out there for my family. It's important to me that if we're spending our hard earned money that we get a top notch product in return. I often rely on the reviews and opinions of others when contemplating purchasing a new product that I haven't tried before myself. Because of that, any products that I buy (whether on Amazon or from a 3rd party) I always make sure to leave a detailed review of the product to help others when selecting items to purchase, as well. My family tests these products fully before forming a solid opinion and writing a review. When I write a review, I keep in mind that those reading are also looking for honesty about the product and want an unbiased opinion to go by. If my review has been helpful to you, please give me a Yes vote on my review. Thank you!"

2,Health & Beauty,,1,can only use my wireless xbox controller for a few hours with two of these
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"I purchased a box of these. First replacement for my outdoor weather info transmitter didn't work so well. Within a couple of days the receiver wasn't receiving a signal from the transmitter, so I changed out the batteries once again. Within 96hrs the receiver once again showed low battery power coming from the transmitter and wouldn't display a temperature reading. This week I'll replace those again (3rd time in 6wks) and expect a low-battery warning just days after. Unsure if I should demand an exchange or full reimbursement. Maybe they do well in warm temps, but in the cold temps they cannot perform like a Duracell or Energizer."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"This is the 2nd time I've ordered these batteries. They work every bit as well as the big name brands, and for the price, you can't beat the value. I will continue to use AmazonBasics batteries in my house- I cannot recommend them enough!"
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Video quality is very good. Works well with Amazon Prime Video and Music - no surprises there. Apps are VERY disappointing - many common apps are not available - even though there are Android versions! Not bad if you have modest expectations.
2,Electronics,,3,"Every other laptop cooler I have purchased has a USB plug to run a fan. Got tired of the fans making noise, the USB or cooler plug not working eventually etc.So gave this one a shot and it does what it says plus. Keeps my 15.6 Mac book pro cool and my legs are not heating up any more when sitting on the couch. Also the bottom does not feel nearly as hot as it used to. So why only 4 stars. The two tabs to keep your laptop from sliding off are not adjustable so when you are typing your arms want to rest on those tabs. Really uncomfortable. So in the pictures you can see a slight modification I made to alleviate this problem. I now rest the laptop on the pads so when typing my arms are resting on the key board portion as if the tabs were not there. Much more comfortable. I used strips of thick felt with sticky bottoms. Certainly not a technical fix but does the job. All they had to do was include a metal piece retrofit on the bottom portion that would allow you to raise your computer to a level so the tabs would not interfere. Simple but maybe on the next model. Check out the two photos."

0,"Electronics,Media",0.0,3,"I purchased the Kindle Oasis because I was growing increasingly tired of the glare and cumbersome size of reading off my iPad. So the portability is great. And of course, I went for the most expensive, because I wanted the extra battery life. And while the length of time it stays charged is nice, charges very quickly, it's still overpriced. I love the non-glare screen, you can literally read this anywhere. But the wifi connectivity is patchy at best. I have to go upstairs in my home and stand close to the router for the Oasis to connect, this is very annoying. Wouldn't be a big deal if I only read from this one device. But I read from another and picking up where I left off is a pain most times. Non of my issues are really a big deal, but for $300 I don't feel like I should have any issues."
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"These are good if you're broke and just need to get by. They work, but like other reviewers are saying, they don't last as long as other brands or rechargeable batteries. If you have the money, invest in batteries that last longer and tax the environment less."

2,Health & Beauty,,2,"I really wanted to love the Amazon AA batteries but they just are not durable enough for my usage. As a night time long distance runner, I have LED headlamps with a rear red flashing light that I use which require 3 AA batteries.I usually purchase Duracell or Energizer batteries in bulk and they have worked well. Rechargeable batteries are not very good in LED Headlamps so those are out.The problem with the Amazon batteries is that I get about 8 or 9 hours of strong light, then it really fades fast. The longest I have used the Amazon batteries is 11 hours and by then, the light is less than 40 brightness. The other issue I noticed with these batteries is that the front headlight will lightly flash in time with the rear light once the front brightness is reduced. When I test the batteries with a tester, they are only 1/2 way through the green range.Duracell and Energizers give me nearly 16 - 18 hours at full brightness and maybe 3 or 4 hours with 40. I have not seen the light flashing when the brightness drops on the these batteries. When I test the batteries after the light is reduced, they are in the yellow or red area.The Amazon Batteries give me two less than the Energizers and Duracells which is significant. I average 5 night time runs with the Duracells and Energizers and 2, sometimes 3 with Amazon Batteries.These may be perfect in remote controls and other static use devices, but if it has to drive a light or a motor, you may want to skip these.The light pictures show new, 5 and 9 hours.The 2nd light shows new and 4 hours.The battery tester shows new, 4, 8 and 11 hours."

Normally that would be good, but I only was using them in a set of LED string lights that I kept on at most an hour a day.

2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Each battery only lasts a few days on my wireless mouse.Update: the problem is actually with my mouse or computer other batteries are also draining too fast. Nevertheless, it would be good if these Amazon batteries stated their capacity."

0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",28.0,2,"I got 2 of this for kids 5 and 3 it is a pretty good tablet, easy to navigate for the children but (and this is on me for not researching) but kid content is only free for a year, after that you gotta pay a monthly fee which is cheaper if you are a prime member, but still...Now reason why I'm about to return them! You CANNOT get YouTube kids at all! No google apps. You can get some YouTube kids clones on the adult profile and add them to the kid's profile but they stink. They're full of commercials.So I wasn't expecting this tablet to be like an iPad but this is a deal breaker for me."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Purchased for a youngster, so I don't have any experience for the device."
0,Electronics,1.0,3,"Moving to this from the first generation Paperwhite appears to have been the right move. I love the new size, it just feels tiny and perfect in the hand. The new automatic brightness setting works quite well. I do wish I could crank up the force required to activate the page turn buttons however, as I have frequently hit them accidentally. The page turn buttons do work with gloves on which a great for reading in a tree stand."
0,Electronics,0.0,1,Slow processor equates to slow internet browsing. User I nterface is ok. Really wish it had the capability to lock onto the movie screen while my toddler watches movies. Next time I'll just spend the additional money on an iPad mini for my kids.
0,Electronics,1.0,1,I bought this tablet for my son and I don't like it. The touch screen is very poor quality. It's hard to move things around on it when he is playing a game. He prefers my iPad than to use his own. I know the iPad quality is probably the best quality but it's way under that! Very frustrating. Will be returning it.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"It works fine, but sensitive to swipe on one side."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,great for the price and last as long as other name brand batteries
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Got this on a Black Friday sale for less than $50. It does just about everything. Play games, internet surf, create documents, read books, takes pictures/videos, streams music and movies in HD; it evens talks to you with the Alexa feature. Expandable up to 256gb of memory. Very fast and reliable tablet. For the price, you will find no equal. I haven't even scratched the surface with everything that it can do. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the camera is only a 2mp resolution; which is surprising, considering they bothered to put a HD screen on the tablet."

2,Health & Beauty,,3,"I use these batteries in my game cameras and they work great, last several weeks."

0,"Office Supplies,Electronics",0.0,2,"We bought this because we thought it would be great for reading books and playing a few games.

There's almost no reason to take this device over the 8."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"A friend gave me a Dot, which I enjoyed. I decided to explore the other devices. I was torn between the Echo and the Tap. After reading a CNET review, I chose the Tap because it is portable. My two frustrations are you cannot change the wake up word ""Alexis"", and you have to be exact in your language when requesting a service. If you are Amazon prime or Audible book member, it is a great addition to you household."

2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Not bad Amazon, not bad.The Good: Price, performance.The Bad: Longevity. If you're using these in anything that's going to see a bit of use, I'd just get the rechargeable which are great quality. For the price increase of some of the larger brands you will be able to replace the batteries several times before spending the same amount of money."

There is a way around it, I do have it on here now but it took some work."

I have ipads and other tablets and I really enjoy reading and watching shows on my kindle fire vs any other tabletThe kid version is kind of annoying. So.many. apps.. ugh.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,good
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"These batteries are a great buy, pretty much can't be beat for the price to quality ratio. I marked off one star because I don't believe they have lasted as long as the Energizer batteries I used previously, but it is not a big difference. I have been using these primarily to power a head lamp with band that I wear at work at night time out in the field. They provide the same brightness as the energizers but my light seemed to start getting dimmer a little sooner than with the energizers. There is not a big enough difference however to justify the price of energizers, therefore I will continue to purchase the AmazonBasics batteries for sure."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"Good price for batteries. Have only used a few of them thus far, but they work."
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,Bought this for my 2 year old since he broke his portable DVD player. The only think I don't like is i had to sneakily download the google App Store so I could install vudu on it.

2,Health & Beauty,,3,Great so far. Let's see how long they last.
0,"Electronics,Media",4.0,3,"I was used to the Kindle 3rd gen(Kindle Keyboard) and when i first held the Oasis it felt very odd and uncomfortable and the metal back made it feel like it could slip and fall at any second. It does take time to get used to. The device is expensive for something that is not even a colored screen. However, my main reason was because it was a bigger screen and clearer ( besides there doesn't seem to be much upgrades between the Kindle Keyboard and the other ones) I find myself accidently touching the touchscreen more often than I would like ( but much less than when I 1st got it- a week or so ago). All in all it is a sleek and nice device, alittle pricey."
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,The fire kid edition 7 is good but not great. Volume is pretty low. But my son throws it around and it doesn't break. Case is stone hard. I also the the brightness on the screen can be a bit low.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Good value - About half the price as the ones in the store. I have been using daily for several weeks and still going strong. No issues with leaking like some cheaper batteries and they come in a box for storage. Will order again.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Overall very good product for kid. Much robust and easy to operate.Only downside is that it is sometimes very slow.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"Somewhat disappointed with these batteries. They die rather quickly. I'm not using them for things that use a lot of power either. Like the remote for my TV. I have to change them frequently. Expiration date of 2026, but they go fast, unless I got a bad batch. I would rate them down there with cheap Rav-o-vac or a grocery store brand."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great value and long lasting.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,My 8 year old loves this so much to do on it. She enjoys reading on it play games .
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,2,There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"My kids have the older model fire, smaller version. They can spend hours on it. This is bigger, better version with a larger screen size. Each child is getting a different color so they know whose is which."
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,We love this table for our 5 y.o. It gives him the sense of independence he wants and me the sense of calmness knowing I can control what he gets on and how long he can spend in screen time!
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Fantastic sound from such a small speaker, excellent! Not as impressed with its other potential capabilities- more difficult to set those up & get all the various apps needed to do things like get weather, order items, etc.. Wish it came with more pre installed I guess."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Last way longer than dollar-store generics!
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Have several echo's throughout the house and bought the Echo Tap so I could move it when I need to move around from the garage to outdside. Mainly listen to music and has worked well. Have noticed that I usually have to yell for Alexa to hear me but that may have to do with the acoustics in the garage. Other than that it works well.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,We bought this as a replacement. My daughter cracked the screen on her other one right before Christmas. We love it! Only issues we have is something she does will make it so only half the apps/games show. However we like she can only play safe age appropriate games and don't have to worry when she's on it.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,Its a nice tablet however it could be better but you get what you pay for
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Ok I purchased this tablet specifically for my two year old for her birthday. So far she loves it but gets tired of the kids included amazon trial videos. So I end up logging into my user account for her to be able to go on YouTube. But she really likes and enjoys her new tablet. Over all it's a good tablet for kids. What had me on purchasing this tablet was the free no question asked replacement warranty. She has dropped it many times but the included foam case has protected the tablet every time.

2,Electronics,,3,"The backpack is great quality. The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because I wouldn't trust the laptop slot alone to protect my laptop. It's not padded enough. If I had a choice I'd rather the laptop slot be replaced with a waterproof cooler space as I purchased this for hiking. That is my only gripe, other than that the bag is great quality, comfortable and has plenty of space. Well worth the price."
0,Electronics,0.0,2,Tablet stopped working after owning for two weeks. Came back on after an hour.
0,Electronics,2.0,2,"Bought this to replace my aging Nexus 7 (2013) version, but didn't hold a candle up to it. I knew it going in, but wanted to see for myself in person. For $80, can't hardly beat the features, but I was spoiled by arguably the best small Android tablet ever made. I knew the screen resolution was lacking, especially on an 8"" screen, but coming from the Nexus, it was a huge difference. Also, even at 4 plus years old, the processor was humming along smoothly. The extra .5 gb ram was also helpful. Anyways, back to the Fire HD 8. One advantage it had over the Nexus, was the expansion slot. I loved being able to put my media on it, but then again, the media displayed on the screen was subpar, so it's a wash. I installed Google play on it, so that it expanded its functionality, and I'm an avid Amazon conneseiur, but found the table too limiting. Ultimately returned and bought an old, discontinued Fire HD 6 for $20. The resolution almost matches that of the Nexus, so I'm happy for now."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,A great value .

Can't beat the price for the amount you get, they work as expected, and long lasting. In my opinion the box they come in is extremely convenient compared to other battery packaging."
0,Electronics,0.0,0,This is just a regular fire tablet that has protective case.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,The batteries are great and for the quantity and price it's a great buy.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Work like they should
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This is a good basic tablet. It does every thing it is advertised well. Great if your a real amazon fan.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good price. Seems to have same life as name brands.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,I'm a huge fan of amazon so I figured I'd give these a shot. These have no life whatsoever. Even something as low-power as tv remotes they only last about 2 weeks tops.Spend the extra money and go with name brand.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"These batteries are okay they don't seem to last as long as brand name batteries, but you can't beat the price for these."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"First of all- buying batteries is never fun . It's also quite expensive. I fell in love with the fact , I could buy these Amazon branded batteries through prime and get them in two days .But guess what. I got them in 1 day!!! Plus , I stocked up for all those dang Christmas toys for my triplets. If I buy one, I have to buy three!!!!They lasted just as long as a standard battery . Plus , I love that they come in a nice cardboard sleeve. Rather than the ones at the store where they all fall out when you rip the plastic from the cardboard.To wrap up- these were very impressive."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Good batteries!
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Work great fast delivery good price
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I bought the Tap to integrate with the Echo. It is ideal for my husbands office where he can use it on his desktop in easy reach for music or to contact Alexa. The wireless feature is great but having sound activation would make this product perfect!

2,Health & Beauty,,1,"I always put new batteries in my three thermostats at the beginning of the heating season in late Sept to make sure they work through the winter. Never had a problem with Energizer or Duracell going the whole year. These batteries from Amazon all had to be replaced in February, won't be using them again."
2,Health & Beauty,,2,I miss the bunny with the drum.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,"Pros: liked the warranty, liked that it came with a case making it cost less than buying one separately. Cons: One grandchild was too old for the games included on his locked portion. Was hoping I could put games on a particular grandchilds site and lock it so he couldn't download other things. Would recommend this only for very young children."

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"My daughter is artistic, and we were looking for a tablet that would not only serve as a teaching tool, but also be able to put up with typical abuse of a toddler. It is only lacking the ability to download apps from the google play store, which can be worked around by downloading the apk files and installing them. The other issue is being able to move said apps from the play store to the child‚Äôs profile of the tablet. I am still working on finding a way to make this happen."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I bought this for my great-grandson who is 3 years old. I had purchased one for his 5 year-old sister for Christmas and it became the object of dispute between them because he wants to use it too. They both enjoy it. It is entertaining and educational. Now they each will have their own and the dispute can end.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Good for leisure/reading for fun. Not for students.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,I purchased these batteries because of the price and the backing of Amazon. I figured Amazon wouldn't put their name on a poor product. I used 12 of these batteries in an application and all 12 failed within a few days. Other batteries lasted months. For now I'll stay away from this product and fork out a few more bucks for a battery from a main stream manufacturer.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Batteries work fine and are less expensive then all of the others on Amazon for sell. Nothing more to say!
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"and then there's cheap. yeah cheap batteries alright but also cheap performance. these last half the time the C's house brand batteries, (in the same unit) for only just a little less money. disappointed as I was hoping Amazon might try to only put their name brand on half way decent stuff.there's a reason they send you a whole big box of 'em, ..... you'll go through 'em fast."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,EXCELLENT PRODUCT
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"Do not last as long as other cut price batteries. In my Canon digital camera I cannot get off more than 3 shots before the 'low-battery' warning comes on. I am going back to Maxell, which did much better for me.I would hate to see what the capacity of the AmazonBasics EveryDay batteries are!!!"

0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,We got this product for our 6 year old. I love the parental controls. Only downfalls I've noticed so far is it takes a long time to charge and there is a lot going on app. Wise on the parent login on this product.
2,Health & Beauty,,0,I received these batteries today and looked at the date after reading another review and the batteries are 4 years out of date. Please don't buy these.

2,Electronics,,2,Isn't the same as the picture.
0,Electronics,0.0,1,"Seemed to be fine as Chtistmas gift for granddaughter. However, today she reported that it wouldn't turn on or charge today. Supposed to have two year unconditional guarantee. Don't know where to take it."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,It's great. I'd buy it again.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Good so far
0,Electronics,1.0,0,"Difficult to purchase. No stock in 6 stores, no order online or ship to store available. When it did become available it did not work. Once it turned on, I couldn't get any further. I could not log onto wifi network, though other items in my household work. Also the product wouldnt move past setting up the clock. Tried 3 days, gave up and returned the item."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,These batteries are great and last very long I would definitely recommend them to a friend or family over the Duracell brand better pricing
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This is something that is useful if your looking for something to take along trips
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Just as good as any other battery in the market place-highly recommended
0,Electronics,9.0,3,"Love it for my boys! We received the 6"" Kids Edition for Christmas last year. The screen cracked a month ago and Amazon promptly replaced the device without incident. Great 2 yr replacement plan! Shortly after that, my older son who previously used a Nook finally broke. I decided since younger brother had a Kids Kindle, that we would purchase a second one to replace the Barnes and Nobles Nook. I love the fact that I can control what is on his profile. I love that it uses a micro usb charger and the warranty was the biggest selling feature. My boys are 5 and 7 and they are not very careful sometimes. My son did however get a kindle with a Pink case because it was all that Best Buy had in stock. I wish that cases were cheaper and I would gladly replace it. Best tablet for this age and in this price range.Cons: No google play store, slow sometimes, have to re-download apps frequently when running out of space, lack of popular apps."
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"I've had good luck with Amazon basics peripheral devices for computers, but the 24 pack of AAA batteries I got had virtually no power out of the package. Perhaps it's a quality control issue, but I got burned on the ones I bought, and won't take another chance with them."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,I have found the amazon batteries work great. Have yet to have any issues.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,Batteries don't last that long I bought these for some of the little round lights that go in your closets or under your cabinets they didn't make it a week which was sad.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,Good tablet but not as smooth as high end tablets. It's limited to Amazon so don't expect to do as much as an Android or iPad. I like mine and will continue to use it. I recommend using one if you can before buying.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,A great buy!! The seem to last just as long as brand names in the devices I use them in

2,Health & Beauty,,2,They seem to die faster than most batteries.
0,Electronics,1.0,3,I purchased this product on a whim with a very limited purpose which was to study for an exam while in the middle seat on a long flight. I expected to hand it to my 10-year old after my exam. The surprise was that really enjoy the device and in particular I like the Amazon account integration: On my next flight I was delighted to find that the unit actually downloads my videos for offline viewing! The best part is that I upgraded the memory with a 64GB SD card so now my available content is awesome! Truth is that my first unit inexplicably failed but Best Buy replaced my unit right away and I expect great things with this new device! My son also uses it on long trips!!!
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"This product, while the speaker is great, fails to deliver with a voice interface. Use your cell phone or computer and buy an Echo Dot."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Great tablet - lag free when running apps... Good battery life. Only downside is lack of ability to screen mirror. Was available on older versions but no longer
0,"Electronics,Media",1.0,3,I absolutely love this reader. The bigger screen is wonderful. My only complaint is the battery does not last as long as advertised.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,I tested each of these batteries and they were indeed batteries. Would buy again!
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"I didn't expect them to be as good as duracell or energizer, but they only lasted a few weeks in my clock."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,So many batteries for such a great price. I'm even handing them out with the Christmas gifts i'm giving so that everyone can just use the gifts i'm giving right away! They last quite a while too. Much better alternative than buying name brand batteries in the store

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This is perfect for young children and comes ready to use straight out of the box. The case is very well built to protect the tablet and the device is actually pretty light and easy to hold. Once you sign in with your 'parent' account, you can set up your child's profile and it's ready to go. Easy to navigate menus with great parental controls - this tablet truly delivers safe content and games for hours of enjoyment. The key is to load new content while you have access to wifi so the books, games and videos are available while traveling."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Amazonbasics products are very satisfied with high quality and low price
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I really liked this tablet. Got it for my nephew who just turned 4. Has many built in kid rated apps which keeps him entertained. The bumper is a bonus in case he drops it too. What I also like is that it had another mode to switch to in case an adult wanted to use it too.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Batteries seem fine. Hard to tell if they are as good as name brand until I use them for a while.
0,Electronics,1.0,1,"If you shop on Amazon all the time, this will help make it easier still. Lots of ads pop up, and you can't use apps from non-Amazon sources unless you root it, and that is complicated. This is not a realistic alternative to an iPad or Galaxy Note. If you just want to a device to shop on Amazon with, you'll love it."

0,Electronics,0.0,1,"The tablet works great when the battery is charged. The problem we have is the provided charging cable connector does not seat well into the tablet's micro USB port and does not have a solid electrical connection.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,If your looking for batteries of the future that are environmentally safe you need only look for NiZn batteries they put out more power and last much longer and are rechargeable.

FACT!!!!!!!!!!PLEASE HELP THE ENVIRONMENT AND USE A MUCH BETTER BATTERY NiZn
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Positives:Not overpriced and extremely user-friendly OS. Recommend that users purchase an Amazon Prime membership if purchasing this item as there are always a ton of free TV shows, movies, books, and games included in the subscription. Prices for items are also reduced. If not, there are occasional free and reduced price items; however, you have to look for them.Negatives: If you do not charge the battery on a consistent basis, there is a chance that the Kindle's internal battery will not charge anymore. This will require the user to return the item and purchase another. If the user keeps too many apps open, the performance drops significantly. The display has a low resolution and the touchscreen does not always respond as quickly as a tablet would."

0,Electronics,1.0,3,"This kindle has good quality for the price I bought it for. It can basically do anything an iPad does, but it is a lot cheaper. I got the kindle when it was on sale . If you are using this kindle, just to browse and watch movies then it's more than enough GBSs."

It was also awesome to be able to get them in 2 days, since our TV buttons are very hard to use so the shorter time without a remote, the better!Work great. Probably won't run out of AAA anytime soon, but would consider buying other sizes when needed."

0,Electronics,0.0,2,Got this for my 10 year old grandson. He really likes it a lot. This is good for kids to learn responsibility using tablets.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I've never had a tablet other than an apple. It seems to charge quite slow but I'm not sure if it's because of the tablet or the cord or some setting I'm not aware of; but it charges ridiculously slow, other than that I am very happy since it's for my son."
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,This is great to occupy your child on the long road trip or just when you need a break from entertaining the little one. Works great and they can damage or mess up their own toys without using your cell phone or other adult device.

2,Health & Beauty,,1,"Several of the (new) batteries do not work. Very frustrating to replace a battery in an appliance and gave it not work and not know whether the problem is the appliance or the battery. Plus some things require several batteries and so it is hard to figure out which battery is not functional...I've experienced this with a couple devices (one wireless mouse and one kids toy) and trying different batteries resolves it, so I'm pretty confident the problem is the batteries."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,great price
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I love it.....Reading E books here is so easyPerfect for price
0,Electronics,0.0,3,good price for the product. I purchased for my middle school son.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"No joke, i was such a skeptic of these batteries. Seriously. But they seem more powerful than the name brand competition.I bought them for use in a breast pump mainly. I noticed with other batteries I was getting a lot less suction but with these it runs full power, just like I'd plugged it in the wall.I don't think I'll buy the name brand batteries anymore. Good job Amazon."
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"These batteries work for normal things. But when i tried to use them for a dog collar that is supposed to help with barking, they were too weak and had to be changed after three uses. Annoying."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I bought this for my 3 year old son for Christmas. It keeps him busy while my wife and I take him out to dinner at a restaurant. It's relatively easy to use and he likes some of the kids videos we downloaded for free.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Really goo batteries for the price
2,Health & Beauty,,2,"And I could have bought Energizer batteries. These are OK, but not a US company. Who knows what damage their manufacture is doing to the planet."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,So far so good. Working well with my light mirror and it's been holding a good amount of power for a good amount of time.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,very good product in its price range affordable and very good
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"As good as the brand name batteries at considerably less cost. I have tried numerous off brand batteries in the past. None of them have ever lasted as long as the name brands, and some were almost dead right out of the box. I have found these batteries to last just as well as the name brand batteries, in both the AA and AAA sizes. I have not tried the D or C cells yet."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Inexpensive, but well built. Easy navigation. Streams movies well. Sound is decent, but requires headphones generally. Screen is good size and clear. Finding a case for this model is a challenge - I found on-line, but expensive considering tablet price. Universal cases don't work due to button placement."
2,Health & Beauty,,1,These batteries don't seem to last quite as long as regular brand name.

2,Health & Beauty,,4,work good
0,Electronics,3.0,3,"I waited for weeks to get this new model and am happy I did. I love the new features on the Kindle Voyage. Didn't give it 5 stars due to some difficulty with the pressure sensitive buttons. I don't know if it is a flaw with the design or operator error, but sometimes it is more challenging than I think it should be to get the page to turn. It is far easier to swipe the screen so this is what I typically do. But, regardless. . . I love the Voyage! It was definitely worth the wait!"
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Great price but didn't last long at all.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Works great for a simple tablet. Not a huge fan of the silk browser but it could be worse! I am very happy with my purchase!

2,Health & Beauty,,1,they are cheep so i guess you get what you pay for. i use them in my kids toys and they don't last long.
0,Electronics,0.0,2,I bought this a first tablet. I'm disappointed in the battery life. I sort of expected better especially as I got hooked on online games.

0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,"Great generic tablet for looking to keep kids occupied. Mine enjoy the FreeTime Unlimited, and the child restrictions are great for my needs.My only concern has been for the space available. I was amazed at how quickly they ate up 32 GB of space on apps."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Work well and good price.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,First time user and very pleased. Great for me because of my book downloads. Not too big and not too small.
0,Electronics,5.0,3,"The Tap is essentially a smaller version of the Echo that has Alexa capability like Echo does, but also doubles as a portable Bluetooth speaker. You do need to tap it to ask Alexa to do anything, but otherwise it works the same as Echo. I prefer the Echo, but the Tap is great for college students and those who just want to supplement their Echo."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Great companion if you already have an echo and need something on the go. Love that this stream and plays Prime music. Battery life could be a little better and sound is good for speaker this size but not the best.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"Very disappointed with these batteries. I was using them in a wall clock. The clock repeatedly did not work after a new battery was put in. I figured the clock was no good, since the batteries were new. Bought a new clock, same thing happened. Decided to test the batteries prior to installation. I found that of the twenty batteries I tested, only 2 tested good. So therefore, my first clock probably wasn't bad in the first place, the batteries are faulty. I still have 12 batteries left to test, but I not hopeful that these will be any better."
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Awesome for the price.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Definitely easy on the eyes for long reading sessions, especially when compared to the LCD screens of smart phones and tablets. The only issues we had were that it drops the connection to our WiFi network and then won't connect to the Kindle store. I don't think it's an issue with my network since all our other devices don't have the connectivity issues we had with this."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,This is my third Kindle Fire. It works beautifully. The only problem I have is little details that are different from previous model. (I'm getting used to it!) As I go I'm learning.....
0,"Office Supplies,Electronics",0.0,2,This is my 3rd Kindle. I have continued to move up on the screen size and this one is so easy to see and read. I do however sometimes have a problem with it when I am online. It can take forever to load up a site and move from page to page so that can be annoying. I have extremely fast internet so that is not the problem and when I check strength of wifi connection it always says excellent so not sure why it takes so long. Do not have that problem on my other 2.
0,Electronics,0.0,3,this was purchased for my granddaughter for her birthday
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Best batteries...Forget the others. These batteries last the same or more
0,Electronics,0.0,3,I bought this item on a whim and because it was on sale. I've been pleasantly surprised. Search sounds great for its size.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Noticed short life and not enough power for some items
2,Health & Beauty,,0,These batteries are very poor quality and do not last even half the time of standard Energizer or Duracell batteries
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Works great with wireless mics.
2,Health & Beauty,,2,Don't hold a charge as long as other comparable batteries
2,Health & Beauty,,3,OK batteries
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"I love my kindle, I can listen to music,read my emails, or pick a book to read. Everything loads up easily."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"great product, great transaction"
0,"Electronics,Media",10.0,3,"I've been a kindle owner since the early days and when new versions have come out in the past, it was usually a no-brainier to upgrade. The oasis was a little challenging because the price really makes you stop and think if this upgrade is worth it. After a lot of thought, the factor that convinced me to switch was the reappearance of the page turning buttons. I missed them since they vanished with the kindle keyboard! The paper white and the voyage were great devices but I often accidentally changed pages if I accidentally pinched the bezel when carrying the device or even just shifting positions on the couch. The Oasis' buttons have removed that issue and I am delighted! The weight and thinness of the device are also appreciated tho the paper white etc are pretty thin already. The addition of the cover is interesting but after a month's use I think it's pretty clear the cover/battery is there only to boost the very short-lived battery in the kindle itself. ""Months"" of battery life just seems impossible unless you keep the screen at low illumination and only read a few minutes a day. The screen is clear and bright, I can't see any LED issues others have complained about and the interface does seem snappier than older versions. Ultimately the only real justification for buying this kindle is if you miss the page turn buttons and want to pay top dollar for them. Otherwise, the existing kindles will meet your needs."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,good value for the amount of batteries
2,Health & Beauty,,3,What can I say. They're AA Alkaline Batteries and they're affordable.-1 Star because the packaging was GIGANTIC compared to the size of the actual batteries.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great batteries for the price last just as long as the other good brands.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Cheap Quality Batteries
2,Health & Beauty,,4,Great
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Super easy to set up and use :)Got one for daughter and got one for self!!!!!!
2,Health & Beauty,,0,These batteries are the worst batteries I've ever purchased. I am in disbelief how quickly they died! I put them in 2 very small 4 tall portable night lights for my kids and both night lights became very dim overnight. The batteries had to be replaced after 2 nights for the night lights to even serve the purpose. I've since put these batteries in other things around the house and I am not impressed at all. I'll stick to buying batteries at Costco in the future.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,"They're a decent value for the amount of batteries (especially on Prime Day) you get. I use them mainly in remotes around the house and other devices, and I haven't had any issues with them leaking. They do drain a little faster than Duracell coppertops, but these are a far better value when caught on sale. I've used both the AA and AAA and they're both decent."
0,Electronics,0.0,2,"It's great for beginners, like children, but very limiting for me. I can't use many apps because it doesn't allow me to use the Google play store."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Bought it as a Christmas present based on input from a friend of mine
2,Health & Beauty,,1,"Great price - but you get what you pay for. In our Xfinity TV remote, these last 25 of the time the Duracell's lasted. Overall, they don't have lasting power like the top brands."
0,Electronics,0.0,3,Wanted something with a kids mode on it so we could limit time and content. This works. Saw it for a really low price so couldn't resist otherwise we would have gotten the padded kids version.

0,Electronics,0.0,3,"This tablet is not a high-tech state-of-the-art Speed Demon, but on the other hand it is more than good enough for daily use. The two biggest benefits to me are that it now comes with Alexa built in, and, you can download Amazon movies to the device to watch offline, for example on an airplane. These two features alone make it worth the very reasonable price."
2,Health & Beauty,,3,Good value.
2,Health & Beauty,,1,These batteries do not have a long life.
2,Health & Beauty,,4,"good price, works great"
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"Got this when it was on sale mainly to get the books not available @ B&N and to play audiobooks. Main drawback: the constant advertising! You turn it on and get a ad. Let it sit for a moment or two, another ad pops up. Ads for nothing I've ever expressed an interest in. Very irritating.Color is very crisp and clean.Love my older Nook but lately B&N doesn't always have the books that are available on Amazon. Will continue to use the Nook as my primary e-reader with the Fire as my primary audiobook player."
2,Health & Beauty,,1,You get what you pay for. These batteries are cheap and don't last as long as Duracels or Energizer. If I had to estimate I'd say they last around 50 as long as those mentioned.
0,"Toys & Games,Electronics",0.0,3,"Very easy to use. Kids love it! Only downsides are lack of certain apps, and the speakers are weak. All in all, a great tablet for under $100"
0,Electronics,0.0,3,"At ninety dollars, the expectionations are low, but this is still a very good table, it's good for light use like watching videos or web browsing, but the camera is a bit lacking, and at certain times the device can freeze or lag.

2,Health & Beauty,,1,These do not work good in cameras. I use a small point and shoot Cannon Camera for work. With these batteries I seem to be changing them almost every time I go out. Other name brand batteries seem to last 3-4 time longer.
2,Health & Beauty,,3,don't last that long
0,Electronics,,3,"It has a surprisingly quick response to the queries that it does recognize. I found its necessary to be rather specific in the way commands are phrased. Also a good bit of set up is involved, including subscription and agreeing to terms and conditions that nobody ever reads. And even then, it seems copyright laws limit the echo.I would like to be able to promt a command with something I choose as apposed to saying Alexa every time. It seems with something so adaptable, this would be easy to make available. Perhaps it is and I simply haven't found how yet.All around fun device, with good quality sound. And with the purchase of the battery adapter base, it's portable to wherever Wi-Fi is available.Thousands of apps skills are available for the echo. Virtually endless fun."

2,Health & Beauty,,4,Fantastic Price on a Great Quality Battery..! They Last a very long time...!!
2,Health & Beauty,,0,"The advertisement promises a 4 channel boat. It is not - only one channel. Consequently, kids can't play simultaneously with more than one boat (which was the reason I bought several). Simple false advertising. The main reason I bought this model over others was that it was promised with multiple channels."

I am visiting, and just opened the brand new package, and inserted 4 of them to run his blood pressure cuff. The machine worked, but the battery indicator showed low, I switched the batteries with other brand new amazon batteries - same reading. Then I switched with another set of name brand batteries, and the battery indicator showed high/full. If I was home, I would have used my battery meter.
